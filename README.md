# AI Cultural Journalist: AAVE Analysis Platform

An autonomous platform tracking and analyzing African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in academic publications and news media through daily analysis.

## Project Vision

This autonomous application monitors the growing presence of Black linguistic contributions in academia and news sources. By analyzing AAVE patterns in scholarly and news content, it provides data-driven insights into how Black language evolves and gains recognition in institutional contexts. The project is built on research from "LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE MODEL WITH CYBER DEFENSE" and aims to expand to track other languages from the African diaspora globally.

## Core Capabilities

- **Automated Daily Analysis**: Collects and analyzes new content from academic and news sources daily
- **Linguistic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies established AAVE features in text using advanced NLP
- **Comparative Analysis**: Tracks differences in AAVE representation between academic and media sources
- **Trend Visualization**: Provides data visualizations of changing linguistic patterns over time
- **Cultural Domain Tracking**: Organizes insights across different domains of Black cultural expression

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Chart.js for data visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with Python microservices
- **Data Sources**: Google Scholar API (via scholarly Python library), News API
- **Analysis**: Custom NLP algorithms for AAVE feature detection
- **Infrastructure**: Automated data collection and analysis pipelines

## Roadmap

- **Current**: AAVE analysis in English-language academic and news sources
- **Upcoming**: Integration of other Black diaspora languages and dialects
- **Future**: Comparative analysis across regional Black linguistic expressions globally

## Research Foundation

This project builds upon linguistic research exploring the structures and patterns of AAVE:

- "LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE MODEL WITH CYBER DEFENSE" (2022)
- Studies on the grammatical patterns and innovations of AAVE
- Research on linguistic code-switching in academic contexts
