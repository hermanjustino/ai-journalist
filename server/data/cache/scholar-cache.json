        "abstract": "This study, which aims to contribute to the valorization of Diospyros mespiliformis fruits, was conducted at the laboratory of Peleforo GON COULIBALY University in Korhogo (Ivory Coast). It aimed, on the one hand, to analyze some physicochemical parameters (moisture content, dry matter, total soluble solids, pH, titrable acidity, and vitamin C content) of Diospyros mespiliformis pulp and, on the other hand, to select potential yeast starters for bioethanol production. Thus, the microbiological analyses of the pulp consisted of testing their fermentative capacity, then subjecting the isolates with high fermentative capacity to the influence of some fermentative parameters (sodium chloride, glucose, and ethanol) on their growth. Physico-chemical parameters revealed that the pulp of Diospyros mespiliformis has a high moisture content (74.97%), an acidic pH of 3.85, a titrable acidity of 1.41%, a vitamin C content of 12.35 mg/100 g, and a soluble dry extract of 5 °B. All these characteristics make the fruits of Diospyros mespiliformis an interesting source of nutrients. Furthermore, microbiological analyses allowed for the isolation and identification of eighty-six (86) yeasts based on their macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Among these isolates, six showed a strong fermentative capacity and exhibited good microbial growth under the influence of the studied fermentative parameters. Thus, these six (6) isolates could be proposed as potential starters in biotechnological applications to standardize and control certain fermentation processes such as bioethanol production.",

        "abstract": "Effective communication is crucial in reducing health disparities. However, linguistic differences, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE), can lead to communication gaps between patients and physicians, negatively affecting care and outcomes. This study examines whether large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Llama 3.3, can replicate AAVE in simulated clinical dialogues to improve cultural sensitivity. We tested four prompt types—BaseP, DemoP, LingP, and CompP—using United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) case simulations. Statistical analyses on the models’ outputs showed a significant difference among prompt types for both GPT-4 (F(2,70) = 6.218, p = 0.003) and Llama 3.3 (F(2,70) = 12.124, p < 0.001), indicating that including demographic information and/or explicit AAVE cues influences each model’s output. Combining demographic and linguistic cues (CompP) yielded the highest mean AAVE feature counts (e.g., 9.83 for GPT-4 vs. 16.06 for Llama 3.3), although neither model fully captured the diversity of AAVE. Moreover, simply mentioning African American demographics triggers extra informal forms, suggesting built-in stereotypes or biases in both models. Overall, these findings highlight the promise of LLMs for culturally sensitive healthcare communication, while underscoring the need for continued refinement to address stereotypes and more accurately represent diverse linguistic styles.

        "abstract": "﻿Abstract In 2013, all populations of the precious wood genera Dalbergia (Fabaceae) and Diospyros (Ebenaceae) from Madagascar were placed on CITES Appendix II in an effort to combat unsustainable and illicit over-exploitation and illegal exportation for the international market. The accompanying Action Plan adopted by CITES identified several information and capacity gaps, which undermine the sustainable and equitable management of these valuable resources. These gaps include the lack of practical, reliable tools to identify species along the entire value chain, from standing trees to cut wood and finished products. To address this need, we developed simple, user-friendly, multi-access keys for the two genera in Madagascar using the Lucid application. This new tool provides highly accurate identification of standing and felled trees to assist actors in the forestry, regulatory, and natural resource management sectors, including customs officials and law enforcement authorities as well as conservationists and protected area managers. In this paper, we focus on the development of the Diospyros identification tool. This interactive, electronic key employs 109 informative characters, including morphological features, emphasizing vegetative structures such as bark, stems, and leaves that are present even in the absence of flowers and fruits, in conjunction with eco-geographic characters (bioclimate, elevation, and geography). The key is supplemented with photos, illustrations, and a comprehensive glossary, to deliver accurate identification of the 88 Diospyros species that are large enough to be potential sources of commercially valuable ebony wood (≥ 20 cm DBH and/or ≥ 20 m height). This is the first use of Lucid to develop an identification key for species in Madagascar, paving the way for its application to other taxa for which practical electronic field identification is needed.",

The nutritional value of the fruit remains largely unexplored, despite its accessibility in the region where cultivated fruits are scarce due to limited irrigational infrastructure. Proximate analysis was conducted to assess ash content, crude fiber, moisture, carbohydrates and protein levels, while also mineral contents analysis focused on calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe) levels, among others. Findings from this research provide essential nutritional information, potentially aiding in converting malnutrition and promoting the health benefits of dried Diospyros Mespiliformis within local communities. This study highlight the nutritional viability of wild fruits as affordable, nutritional alternatives to cultivated varieties, especially in low resources settings.",

        "title": "Evaluation of ebony as a potential selectable marker for genetic sexing in Aedes aegypti",
        "abstract": "Background Aedes aegypti is expected to invade previously unoccupied areas, mainly due to the climate change, the increase in travel and trade activities and the continuous transformation of the rural environment into urban areas. The sterile insect technique (SIT), which relies on the mass production and release of sterile males, is an environmentally friendly approach that can be applied for population control of Ae. aegypti. SIT programs can be greatly benefited by a genetic sexing strain (GSS) and a reliable sex sorting system to minimize any accidental female release. Visually detectable or conditionally lethal selectable markers can be used for the development of new GSSs. In this study, we evaluated the suitability and competence of a mutant Ae. aegypti ebony strain for the development of a new GSS. The ebony gene is known to be involved in the pigmentation pathway of several dipteran insects, including Ae. aegypti. Methods An ebony gene knockout was developed though CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. G0 individuals with the desired phenotype were crossed, and progeny were screened in every generation. PCR and sequencing were performed using gDNA from a pulled leg to determine the mutant genotype. Quality control tests, including pupae and adult recovery rates, male sex ratio and fecundity, were applied to the ebony mutant line to determine whether the mutation confers any fitness cost. Results An Ae. aegypti ebony knockout mutant carrying a 5-bp deletion was obtained, which presented darker head and siphon phenotypes at the larval stage. However, genetic analysis revealed that this ebony mutation results in incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The establishment of a pure ebony mutant line was not possible because of the fitness costs conferred by the mutation. Conclusions In this study, the adequacy and suitability of the ebony gene as a selectable marker for the development of a GSS in Ae. aegypti were assessed. Despite its clear phenotype early in larval development, the homozygous mutant line presented phenotypic inconsistency and loss of fertility. These drawbacks clearly indicate that this particular mutation is not suitable for the development of a new GSS. Nonetheless, it cannot be excluded that a different mutation will lead to a different expression and penetrance profile and a viable homozygous mutant line.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The presence of a selection marker in transgenic plants has raised public concerns regarding health safety. We have developed a CRISPR/Cas9‐based DNA delivery system termed transgenic selection‐associated fragment elimination (T‐SAFE). The T‐SAFE system comprises four cassettes: the selection marker, CRISPR/Cas9, spacer‐plus‐protospacer adjacent motif (SP), and the cargo. The first two cassettes, the selection marker and CRISPR/Cas9, are collectively referred to as SCC. The SCC is flanked by two identical SPs derived from the fruit fly Ebony gene, which efficiently facilitate the SCC cleavage and subsequently lead to self‐elimination of the selection marker upon integration of exogenous DNA into the plant genome. To inhibit the production of a functional Cas9 protein in bacteria, the IV2 intron of the potato ST‐LS1 gene has been incorporated into the Cas9 gene. Additionally, the Cas9 gene is driven by a reproductive cell‐specific or inducible promoter to avoid SCC cleavage in nonreproductive plant cells. These innovative features allow the T‐SAFE system to achieve an elimination efficiency of the selection marker ranging from 10%–30% in Arabidopsis and 5%–8% in rice, with a DNA delivery capacity of approximately 10 kb. This approach offers a safe means for genetically modifying plants.",

In tephritids, understanding the molecular basis of mutant traits is also crucial for applied entomology, enabling the creation of genetic sexing strains through genome editing, thus facilitating sex-sorting before sterile insect releases. Here, we present evidence from classical and modern genetics showing that the black pupae (bp) phenotype in the GUA10 strain of Anastrepha ludens is caused by a large deletion at the ebony locus, removing the gene’s entire coding region. Targeted knockout of ebony induced analogous bp phenotypes across six major tephritid agricultural pests, demonstrating that disruption of Ebony alone is sufficient to produce the mutant trait in distantly related species. This functional characterization further allowed a deeper exploration of Ebony’s role in pigmentation and development across life stages in diverse species. Our findings offer key insights for molecular engineering of sexing strains based on the bp marker and for future evolutionary developmental biology studies in tephritids.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Kusmintarsih ES, Gemilang P, Nuryanto A, Mahmoud HHA, Ambarningrum TB. 2024. Phylogeny of Wolbachia in Drosophila mutant from Bandung Indonesia. Biodiversitas 25: 4894-4899. Wolbachia is a microorganism known as an intracellular endosymbiont in arthropods that causes reproductive changes and most commonly cytoplasmic incompatibility. Wolbachia pipientis A has been divided into two major subgroups (A and B) and 17 subgroups. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the presence of Wolbachia subgroup in Drosophila mutants and to analyze the phylogeny, of Wolbachia in Drosophila mutants using Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) primer genes. The presence of Wolbachia was determined based on the DNA band pattern on the agarose gel. The phylogenetic relationship among Wolbachia in Drosophila mutants was inferred from a phylogenetic tree. Based on the neighbor-joining method, the phylogenetic tree reconstruction was done in MEGA X software. The result shows that Wolbachia from 7 types of Drosophila mutant samples (taxi, ebony, dumpy, miniature, sepia, white, eye missing, in one subgroup as Wolbachia sp. wMel isolate Yunnan outer surface protein precursor (wsp) gene, partial cds., while between samples and out-group is closely related to Wolbachia sp. in Diabrotica cristata 16S rRNA sub-group A. This result is the first systematic survey of Wolbachia in Drosophila mutants and the first survey classifying Wolbachia infections by subgroup. The research future is to explore Wolbachia in many more insects.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The body color and patterns of insects play important roles in foraging, evading predators, mating, thermoregulation, and environmental adaptation. During the rearing of the QiufengN silkworm strain, a mutant with black pupal cuticle (QiufengNBP) was discovered. Preliminary map-based cloning and sequence analysis indicated that the ebony gene might significantly influence the formation of the black pupa mutant and the expression of 30K proteins. This study aims to determine the function of the ebony gene and its effect on the expression of the 30K protein during the pupal stage; Methods and Results: We employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to knock out the ebony gene in the Nistari strain, resulting in individuals with black pupae, named Nistari Black Pupa (NisBP). This confirmed that the ebony gene plays a crucial role in black pupa formation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis of the pupal cuticle of NisBP and its wild-type Nistari found that the ebony gene has a significant impact on the expression of 30K proteins, which are vital for embryonic development and serve as key storage proteins; Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate that the ebony gene affects the expression of 30K proteins, laying the foundation for further research on their functions and providing insights into the developmental mechanisms of silkworms.",

        "title": "A transformer-based approach to Nigerian Pidgin text generation",
        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a transformer-based text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin also known as Naijá, a popular language in West Africa. Despite its wide use, Nigerian Pidgin remains under-resourced, particularly in areas related to text generation and natural language processing. These difficulties are primarily due to technological constraints rather than the language’s fundamental attributes. There is currently a demand for Nigerian Pidgin-specific solutions because it is used in everyday communication and has a unique linguistic blend. This paper aims to close this gap by exploring the application of state-of-the-art transformer technology to develop a text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin. This work uses the public Afriberta-corpus dataset to optimize the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) model across a sizeable dataset. The performance evaluators, BLEU and Perplexity metrics provide a detailed breakdown of the model’s text quality and predictive accuracy. Despite the difficulties caused by a limited amount of training data, preliminary evaluations show that the model can generate coherent Nigerian Pidgin text. The performance evaluation yielded perplexity scores of 43.56 for variable target reference length and 43.26 for fixed text length. BLEU scores of 0.15 for fixed max length and 0.56 for variable reference target length. This highlights the quality of generated text and the significant improvement when the generated text length is aligned with the reference target. Our work was benchmarked against African American Vernacular (AAVE) revealing that BLEU scores for AAVE are significantly lower than those for Standard American English, with BLEU given as 0.26. Our Nigerian Pidgin model, with a BLEU score of 0.56, shows a better performance. However, both results suggest that both dialects are challenging for language models. Leveraging the pre-trained transformer-based language model and evaluation metrics, we showcase the model’s capacity for coherent Nigerian Pidgin text generation. For future research, the research work can serve as a good foundation for advancement and progress in the Nigerian Pidgin language generation and other low-resource languages.",

        "abstract": "This study sought to examine the influence of teachers’ welfare on their job performance in public secondary schools in Ebony State, Nigeria. Using a mixed approach, the study employed descriptive co-relational design. The population for the study was 384 teachers out of which the sample size of 196 respondents was drawn. Systematic random sampling was used to select respondents. The objectives were: to determine the level of teacher welfare; level of teachers’ job performance; to examine the relationship between teachers’ welfare and their job performance; and the influence of welfare on teachers’ job performance. Data were collected using a self-designed questionnaire whose validity and reliability were confirmed through computation of content validity index (CVI) and Cronbach Alpha test which were found to be 0.76 and 0.81 respectively. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean, Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis. The quantitative results revealed that the level of welfare for teachers is poor and the level of teachers’ job performance is moderate among others. The study concludes that, despite their reasonable job performance, employees’ welfare is poorly cared for. The study recommends among others, that the government and the school administrators should improve on the welfare scheme they offer to teachers to achieve quality secondary education through a high level teacher performance.",

This study presents here a detailed analysis of the diversity and distribution of Diospyros species across 20 sites in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, encompassing different forest types. Data collected from belt transects were used to calculate species richness and quantitative characters such as frequency, density, abundance, importance value index, basal area cover, and distribution type. Alpha and beta diversity across the different study sites were also determined. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis was performed to study the relationship between forest types and species composition. The results indicate Diospyros montana had the greatest frequency, density, basal area cover, and importance value. Agumbe and Hosagunda areas of Shivamogga district, and Makutta region of Kodagu district, showed rich diversity.",

        "abstract": "Velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L.) has a high protein and carbohydrate content. However,\nit is only used by the community as processed plant-based foods. The lack of utilization of\nthis bean is also due to the presence of cyanide and anti-nutritional compounds. This study\naimed to find a new approach to improve the optimization of the combination of velvet\nbean and soybean tempe formula and consumer panelist acceptance by implementing the\nresponse surface methodology (RSM) and the rate-all-that-apply (RATA) method on\nsensory profiles. Preliminary research showed that 48 hrs-soaked velvet bean was chosen\nas the main treatment because it reduced the content of phytic acid 84.17% (1.78 mg/g)\nand cyanide 87.64% (1.09 mg/g) and had the highest protein content (28.82 g/100 g wb).\nThe RSM showed that the variable formula of the velvet bean-soybean combination tempe\n(30.62: 69.37%) had a protein content of 18.47% and a hardness of 2.04 kgf. Sensory\ncharacteristics were evaluated by comparing the aroma, color, texture, appearance, taste,\nand overall characteristics of 100% velvet bean and combination tempe. The hedonic\nrating method revealed an increase in panelists' preference for the combination tempe on\nthe aroma, texture, taste, and overall characteristics. Based on sensory characteristics, the\noptimal combination tempe has a somewhat like to like score on the overall attributes of\nfresh tempe (5.64) and fried tempe (5.48) higher than the velvet bean tempe. Furthermore,\nthe RATA method was used to assess consumer perceptions of the intensity of fresh and\nfried 100% velvet bean, combination, and 100% soybean tempe attribute. Fresh tempe\nmade from 100% soybean seemed to have soft texture characteristics as well as whiteness,\nyellow-white, and solid-compact appearance. Meanwhile, 100% fresh velvet bean tempe\npossessed rancid aroma, hardness, integrated texture, and fibrous appearance. The\ncombination tempe had a yellow-ebony, brown-ebony and gray-ebony color as well as\nsweet, fermented and mushroom aroma. The 100% soybean fried tempe also had savoryumami aroma, beany, and golden-yellow color. Fried tempe made from 100% velvet bean\nhad sweetness, aroma (rancid, fermented and mushroom), taste (oily and bitter) and\nsourness characteristics. Meanwhile, the combination tempe was shown to have dominant\ncharacteristics such as color (brown-ebony and gray-ebony), hardness and fibrous\nappearance.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effects of swallow bird droppings bokashi on several soil chemical properties such as pH, C-Organic, N, P, K, CEC, and to determine the appropriate dosage of bokashi fertilizer for the growth of ebony seedlings. This research was conducted at Permanent Nursery located at Tadulako University. This study was conducted using a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 4 replications, 20 experimental units as: P0 (control), P1 (7 tons/ha), P2 (14 tons/ha), P3 (21 tons/ha), and P4 (28 tons/ha). The results showed that the swallow droppings bokashi fertilizer was able to improve: soil pH 7.18 to 7.55 with a neutral status, P from 41.34 to 65.06 with very high status, K from 46.26 to 53.87 with high status, C-Organic from 5.30 to 10.25 with high to very high status, and N-Total from 0.12 to 0.34 although in low status in the soil. The application of swallow droppings bokashi into the soil was very much needed. C-Organic content in swallow droppings bokashi was 50.23%, N (4.26). The application of swallow droppings bokashi with a treatment of 21 tons/ha (61.25 g/pot) was the best dose for the growth (height) and the increase number of leaves of ebony seedlings.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable diversity of insect pigmentation offers a captivating avenue for exploring evolution and genetics. In tephritid fruit flies, decoding the molecular pathways underlying pigmentation traits also plays a central role in applied entomology. Mutant phenotypes like the black pupae (bp) have long been used as a component of genetic sexing strains, allowing male-only release in tephritid sterile insect technique applications. However, the genetic basis of bp remains largely unknown. Here, we present independent evidence from classical and modern genetics showing that the bp phenotype in the GUA10 strain of the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, is caused by a large deletion at the ebony locus resulting in the removal of the entire protein-coding region of the gene. Targeted knockout of ebony induced analogous bp phenotypes across six tephritid species spanning over 50 million years of divergent evolution. This functionally validated our findings and allowed for a deeper investigation into the role of Ebony in pigmentation and development in these species. Our study offers fundamental knowledge for developing new sexing strains based on the bp marker and for future evolutionary developmental biology studies in tephritid fruit flies.",

        "abstract": "In this essay, I explore the complex intersection of language, identity, and education with a particular focus on the importance of fostering linguistic equity in higher education settings. It is imperative for higher education institutions to reevaluate language-related practices and foster linguistic diversity and equity. Drawing upon linguistic theories and real-world examples, I highlight how language is deeply intertwined with personal identity, culture, and heritage. Various English dialects, such as African American Vernacular English, Chicano English, and others, are highlighted as valid linguistic expressions rather than deviations from a supposed standard. The role of standard academic English (SAE) in academia is examined, with a critical examination of how it can unintentionally perpetuate linguistic prejudice and inequality. I highlight activities in one university and provide practical strategies and classroom approaches to promote linguistic equity by showcasing rubric adjustments and teaching techniques that accommodate diverse language backgrounds. Educators can create inclusive learning environments that empower students to communicate effectively and celebrate their linguistic diversity, ultimately breaking free from historically biased language standards.",

Finding the quality index values for different cropping strategies in plot 17 of Wanagama Educational Forest 1 was the aim of this study. The soil quality index was determined using three methods: simple addition, scoring and weighting, and summation. The results show that in plot 17 of the Wanagama forest, the highest soil quality index values were found for ebony species and the lowest soil quality index values were found for mahogany and Eucalyptus species. The results showed that all land uses with different types of forest plants had lower soil quality indices. The stepwise analysis results showed that porosity, organic C, cation exchange capacity (CEC), P availability, K availability, and C biomass influenced the soil quality index. Measuring soil quality can help you learn more about soil properties and how to improve it through effective management.",

        "abstract": "Diospyros L. is a large genus of flowering plants predominantly distributed in the tropics. It comprises over 700 species globally and around 300 are believed to occur in South-East Asia. Many species are economically important and exploited for the production of ebony wood and persimmons, yet taxonomic information on the genus is incomplete and inconsistent due to its morphological and nomenclatural complexity. Revisions of Diospyros in continental and insular South-East Asia were conducted independently by different authors, occasionally with different names used for the same species, or different species being given the same name in different countries. During our ongoing study of the genus Diospyros in Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam), we identified several such instances. Here, we clarify the most commonly misidentified species, including 1) D.  apiculata Hiern, D. strigosa Hemsl. and D. tamiriensis Lecomte; 2) D. bejaudii Lecomte and D. retrofracta Bakh.; 3) D. dictyoneura Hiern and D. hasseltii Zoll.; 4) D. borneensis Hiern and D. fecunda H.R.Fletcher. Lectotypifications are also made for D. brachiata King & Gamble var. lanceolata H.R.Fletcher, D. fecunda, D. similis Craib and D. strigosa.",

In addition, the nature of ebony seeds is recalcitrant, so they cannot be stored for a long time. Other factors affecting seed germination are the degree of maturity, size, and weight of the seeds. Seeds harvested before the physiological maturity level would not have high viability and even could not germinate well due to the in-sufficient of food reserves, and un-perfect embryo formatio. Bio-fertilizer is used to help accelerate the growth of ebony. This study aims to analyze the combination of bio fertilizers which would be giving a better effect on the physiological activity and growth of ebony seedlings. Morphological and physiological variables measurement were used in this study. The research design used a Completely Randomized Design at a real level of 5%. If the fingerprint results obtained have a real effect, then a further test of the Duncan Multiple Range Test is carried out. Re- search results showed that seed coating treatment of 45% Penicillium microbial solution + seed coating) gave the best results in each variable of both growth and physiology of ebony seedlings, while in the treatment without seed coating, Sargassum microbial solution 30% indicates good results in each variable of growth and physiology of ebony seedlings. Treatment with the immersion of seeds in microbes can produce a high percentage in each variable.",

        "abstract": "The endemic Diospyros celebica and widely spread D. blancoi are two valuable species of Diospyros (the genus of persimmons and ebonies) that have been conserved at botanic gardens in Indonesia. Understanding the biological contrasts between endemic and widely spread species is essential for plant conservation. This study aims to compare the phenotypic and estimated genetic variability between the endemic D. celebica and the widely spread D. blancoi to support their conservation. Fifty-three morphological characters from fifteen selected living plant specimens at Purwodadi Botanic Garden were measured directly or using variable encoding methods. Unpaired two-samples Wilcoxon test and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to compare morphological variations between both species. Further, genetic variabilities were estimated from encoded morphological characters using GenAlEx 6.503 software. The two Diospyros’ morphological characters were significantly different, except for the lamina length, pairs of leaf vein, number of flowers in each inflorescence, and the fruit sulci presence. The cluster analysis successfully distinguished D. celebica from D. blancoi according to thirteen comparable morphological characters. The endemic D. celebica has lower genetic variability (female/bisexual %P = 86.21%, He = 0.259, uHe = 0.277; male P = 54.29%, He = 0.195, uHe = 0.234) than the widely spread D. blancoi (female/bisexual %P = 86.76, He = 0.311, uHe = 0.355). Due to the importance of genetic diversity in plant conservation, both species’ population size needs to be maintained, if not increased, to preserve the existing phenotypic and genetic variabilities within the cultivated populations at the botanic garden.",

We measure cost stickiness using four widely accepted models and a sample of non-financial firms sourced from Compustat. Our findings highlight the significant influence of WCM on cost behavior. Specifically, we observe an inverse relationship between a firm’s WCM aggressiveness and both its cost stickiness and degree of cost adjustment. These relationships are consistent for both operating costs and the costs of goods sold.",

        "abstract": "The different mechanical properties of the materials from which the tailpieces are made have a noticeable effect on the acoustic performance of the violin. These elements are made today from ebony, rosewood, boxwood, aluminium, or plastic. The aim of this study was to check the exact impact of tailpieces made of different materials on the frequency response function (FRF) of a violin’s bridge and the timbre of the instrument’s sound. For this purpose, the bridge FRF measurement was carried out, and a psychoacoustic test was conducted. The material from which the tailpiece is made to the greatest extent affects the modal frequencies in the range 530–610 Hz (mode B1+), which mainly manifested itself in a change in the instrument’s timbre in terms of the brightness factor. The study showed that the lighter the tailpiece, the darker the sound of the violin. It was also revealed that the selection of accessories affects factors such as openness, thickness, and overall quality of the sound.",

        "abstract": "Polandball, or Countryballs, are online user-generated comics about geopolitical satire, with countries personified in spherical characters. One of the most important aspects of Countryball memes is the non-standard English, or Engrish, used in the conversations between characters. This research delves into the Engrish phenomena by collecting and qualitatively examining 200+ comics in the subreddit r/polandball, proposing plausible causes of the phenomena, and raising concerns regarding the implications of the exhibited linguistic stereotypes. The investigation figures out that the language choice in Polandball comics on Reddit generally ranged between serious cultural misunderstanding and code-switching of English with another language. It is concluded that the linguistic stylizations of non-standard English in Polandball comics might be rooted in certain cultural and racial stereotypes and might further reinforce these biased cross-cultural perceptions. The research shed light on the long-ignored African-American Vernacular English appropriation in Polandball comics, and extensively enumerated and identified the most recent Engrish stylizations in Polandball comics.",

Its specific goal is to investigate the occurrence of code-switching between Standard English (SE) and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the singer's lyrics within different music domains. So, we analyzed the frequency of five AAVE syntactic structures in different music genres - hip hop and rap - in distinct phases of her career. The results show an overall decrease of SE forms and an increase in the use of AAVE forms, though the singer continues to practice code-switching in her songwriting. This represents a transition in Beyoncé's language use, indicating a correlation between language choice and Black Women discourse identity.",

This exquisite wood has been in high demand globally due to its aesthetic appearance, resulting in its trade for many years since the pre-colonial period. This paper aims to explore the history of ebony in the global trade network and its exploitation in Central Sulawesi in the first half of the 20th century. This paper relied on a variety of sources including newspapers, government documents, botanical magazines, and other literature related to the topic. This paper reveals that the exploitation of ebony during the colonial period was massive, especially during the 1930s. Europe, America, and Japan were the primary export destinations for ebony, with Japan being the largest consumer of this wood. The significant exploitation of ebony raised concerns for the Dutch East Indies as it became increasingly scarce by the end of the 1930s.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Higher male:female operational sex ratio (OSR) is often assumed to lead to stronger sexual selection on males. Yet, this premise has been directly tested by very few studies, with mixed outcomes. We investigated how OSR affects the strength of sexual selection against two deleterious alleles, a natural ebony mutant and a transgenic GFP insertion, in Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, we estimated the relative paternity share of homozygous mutant males competing against wild-type males under different OSRs (1:2, 1:1, 2:1). We also manipulated the mating pool density (18, 36, or 54 individuals) and assessed paternity over three consecutive days, during which the nature of sexual interaction changed. The strength of sexual selection against the ebony mutant increased with OSR, became weaker after the first day, and was little affected by density. In contrast, sexual selection against the GFP transgene was markedly affected by density: at the highest density, it increased with OSR, but at lower densities, it was strongest at 1:1 OSR, remaining strong throughout the experiment. Thus, while OSR can strongly affect the strength of sexual selection against “bad genes,” it does not necessarily increase monotonically with male:female OSR. Furthermore, the pattern of relationship between OSR and the strength of sexual selection can be locus-specific, likely reflecting the specific phenotypic effects of the mutation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThis letter to the editor is in response to the Gerlach-Houck and DeThorne (2023) epilogue regarding their proposal for speech-language pathologists to offer Autistic code-switching (Autistic masking and camouflage) as a viable, non-ableist social communication tool that Autistic clients may choose to use in \"high-stakes\" social situations. In connection with Autistic code-switching, the authors reference \"the debate\" regarding code-switching in \"African American Vernacular English speakers,\" specifically, whether \"standard\" English should be encouraged as a way to access \"conventional forms of success.\"\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nProfessionally training Autistic clients to \"code-switch\" with the goal of improving the client's chances of accessing conventional forms of success is essentially training Autistic masking and camouflaging. This type of therapy reinforces to both the Autistic client, as well as society, the position that hiding a person's Autistic traits is a pathway to acceptance and success. Autistic camouflaging has detrimental ramifications for mental health outcomes; perpetuates both internalized and societal stigma; hinders bias and discrimination deconstruction; reinforces ableist values; and fails to dismantle power inequities and social barriers that lead to marginalization, oppression, and exclusion.",

        "abstract": "A review at various models illustrates the necessary of choosing a model that can best describe each wood in relation to its isotherms of desorption. The theoretical models enable us to deduce several thermo physical parameters. The models of Dent and G.A.B are quite appropriate in the evaluation of the isotherms of desorption of Ayous and Ebony woods taking the humidity of the atmosphere air into consideration. The parameters of Dent’s model vary favourably with regard to the theoretical precisions. The level of humidity at fiber saturation points are at 0.2944 for Ayous wood and 0.19141 for Ebony wood. The specific surface area occupied by the woods under study decreases when there is a consequent increase in temperature. The specific surface area of Ayous wood ranges between 295 and 162 m2/g whereas that of Ebony ranges between 183 and 96 m2/g, while the wood temperatures vary between 20 and 60°C. It is realised that, there is a powerful relationship existing between the primary hydrophiles of Ebony and the first layer of mater molecules. The desorption heat of multi layers of our woods are superior to latent heat condensation of pure water. The heat condensation of water vapour constitutes a specific given which is superior to the heat isosteric adsorption of the woods in question. The soret effect is more important in the drying of Ayous wood than that of Ebony. However, temperature does not influence the soret effect for Ebony wood, relative air humidity is less than 0.85. This limits Ayous wood at 0.9. Above these limits soret effect increases when there is an increase in atmospheric air temperature.",

The common names include B. acuminata, mountain ebony, camel’s foot tree, kachnar, and butterfly ash. Angiosperm tree could be widely used as a medicinal plant common in tropical regions. Flowers, buds, stems, roots, bark, seeds, and leaves have been used to treat many ailments since ancient times. NSAIDs are one of the most important classes of drugs used today, and several clinical problems require long-term use. As a result of long-term use, side effects, especially stomach ulcers, can worsen the patient’s clinical symptoms. So there is a requirement to go for painkillers, but it is not related to problems even with chronic use. The literature says that a lot of analytical work has been done on this plant, but none of it has been evaluated for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. An aqueous ethanolic extract was prepared and its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects were evaluated in animal models. The results showed that the flower extract at 200 mg/kg dose had significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects compared to the medicinal active drugs.",

Hutan ini banyak ditumbuhi vegetasi jenis pohon Johar (Senna siamea) dan Gaharu (Aquilaria malaccensis). Hutan ini juga menjadi salah satu sumber air bagi masyarakat sekitar Pesanggrahan sehingga perlu dijaga kesehatan dan kelestariannya. Namun, beberapa aktivitas terakhir seperti pembukaan wisata alam Alas Kasinan (Alaska) berpotensi mengganggu habitat flora dan fauna mengingat banyak spesies tumbuhan yang dieksploitasi. Flora dan fauna yang ada disekitar wisata dapat terganggu, sehingga perlu adanya studi untuk menilai keadaan kenakeragaman hayati yang ada di dalam Hutan Lindung Kasinan. Studi ini bertujuan untuk menginventarisasi keanekaragaman jenis flora dan fauna yang ada di dalam Hutan Lindung Kasinan. Metode yang digunakan dalam studi ini yaitu observasi dan wawancara masyarakat serta literasi digital guna mendapatkan data. Hasil studi menunjukkan 29 spesies dari 27 famili telah teridentifikasi. Spesies flora Fabaceae dan banyak spesies burung hidup di Kawasan Hutan Lindung Kasinan. Spesies Pohon Johar (Senna siamea) menjadi spesies penting yang hidup karena memiliki nilai Indeks Nilai Penting (INP) tertinggi yaitu 74,80% yang dapat mengendalikan proses ekologis pada ekosistem Hutan Lindung Kasinan. Terdapat spesies yang menjadi pertanda baik bagi kondisi hutan yaitu adanya spesies Burung Elang Jawa (Nisaetus bartelsi) sebagai predator, Burung Cekakak Jawa (Javan kingfisher) sebagai indikator lingkungan yang asri, Capung Jarum (Ebony jewelwing) sebagai indikator kebersihan sumber air dan Burung Madu Sriganti (Nectarinia jugularas) yang dapat membantu proses perkembangbiakan tumbuhan.",

In this study, a new bioactive compound was isolated and characterized from extracted locally oak goal crude (EOGC). A novel mixture of (methanol 10% + acetonitrile 10% +water 80%) solvents was performed to fractionate the Soxhlet EOGC through a column chromatography technique. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) were utilized to study the constituents of the fractions. The isolated fractions were collected and tested against , Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 , Micrococcus luteus ATCC 19404, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella ebony NTCT 6017 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 utilizing the agar well diffusion method. Results demonstrated that only a single component fraction exhibited activity against ( S. aureus , M. leutues , and C. albicans ), in contrast, no detectable activity was observed against E. coli and S. ebony . Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Mass Spectrometer techniques have been used to characterize the chemical composition of the compound. As a result, the new compound was postulated as Chrysin-gallate compound, which is considered a new bioactive chemical compound that may have a significant application as an antimicrobial and treat specific health issues.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of Batesian mimicry – whereby harmless species avoid predation through their resemblance to harmful species – has long intrigued biologists. In rare cases, Batesian mimicry is linked to intraspecific colour variation, in which only some individuals within a population resemble a noxious ‘model’. Here, we assess intraspecific colour variation within a widespread New Zealand stonefly, wherein highly melanized individuals of Zelandoperla closely resemble a chemically defended aposematic stonefly, Austroperla cyrene. We assess convergence in the colour pattern of these two species, compare their relative palatability to predators, and use genome‐wide association mapping to assess the genetic basis of this resemblance. Our analysis reveals that melanized Zelandoperla overlap significantly with Austroperla in colour space but are significantly more palatable to predators, implying that they are indeed Batesian mimics. Analysis of 194,773 genome‐wide SNPs reveals an outlier locus (ebony) strongly differentiating melanic versus non‐melanic Zelandoperla. Genotyping of 338 specimens from a single Zelandoperla population indicates that ebony explains nearly 70% of the observed variance in melanism. As ebony has a well‐documented role in insect melanin biosynthesis, our findings indicate this locus has a conserved function across deeply divergent hexapod lineages. Distributional records suggest a link between the occurrence of melanic Zelandoperla and the forested ecosystems where the model Austroperla is abundant, suggesting the potential for adaptive shifts in this system underpinned by environmental change.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the risks of hair dye exposure, we investigated cellular and molecular effects of Arianor Ebony dye, which is a mixture of azo and anthraquinone dyes, used in the composition of the black color. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and gene expression of relevant molecules of apoptotic and oxidative stress mechanisms were investigated in HepG2 cells exposed to Arianor Ebony. Results showed that the dye did not induce cytotoxicity to exposed cells at a concentration up to 50 µg/mL compared to the negative control. However, genotoxic assays indicated that the dye was able to damage the genetic material at a concentration of 25 µg/mL, with induction factor values of exposed cells two- to five-fold higher than those recorded for the negative control. Moreover, the lowest observed effect concentration was 12.5 µg/mL. For gene expression, relevant changes were observed in cytochrome c and caspase 9, which decreased in cells incubated with the dye in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the negative control. In parallel, the expression of genes for antioxidant enzymes was increased in exposed cells, suggesting the presence of metabolic routes that protect cells against the toxic effect of the dye, avoiding exacerbated cellular death. Results suggested that the dye disrupted cellular homeostasis through mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be hazardous to human health. Thus, further investigations are necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms of action of the dye, considering its toxic potential found in our ex vivo assays.",

        "abstract": "CRISPR mutagenesis is an efficient way to disrupt specific target genes in many model organisms. We previously devised a targeted CRISPR recombination method to generate intragenic recombinants of alleles in Drosophila. Here, we assessed the applicability of CRISPR targeting‐induced recombination to different genetic loci. We compared the ectopic recombination rates in the male germline by CRISPR targeting at two neighboring genetic loci within the genomic region that consists of the repressed chromatin domain of the Lobe gene, and the transcriptionally active domain of PRAS40. Targeting around the transcription initiation of PRAS40 resulted in higher recombination rates of homologous chromosomes than targeting at the Lobe intron. Based on the efficient homologous recombination by CRISPR targeting observed around transcriptionally active loci, we further investigated targeted recombination between P‐elements that are inserted at different genomic locations. Male recombination by CRISPR targeting of P‐elements located proximally and distally to the ebony gene produced recombinants deficient for the intervening region of ebony transcription. Taken together, we suggest that targeted homologous recombination by CRISPR targeting may have specific genetic applications, such as generation of allelic combinations or chromosomal variations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Animals deliver an important ecosystem service by dispersing plant seeds. Seed dispersers have different effects on the germination success of seeds. This study aimed at examining the effect of seed processing by the patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas) and two flying foxes (Micropteropus pusillus and Epomophorus gambianus) on the germination success of African ebony (Diospyros mespiliformis). Flying foxes and patas monkeys were kept in cages and fed ad libitum with African ebony fruits. Seeds processed were collected, measured, and germinated. Seeds processed by monkeys and flying foxes were compared to control seeds which were removed by hand from fruits. Our results showed that the patas monkey and flying foxes preferably processed smaller seeds. Flying foxes improved the germination success from 6.67 to 72.5%. They also reduced the mean germination time up to 5 days. The patas monkey also improved the germination success from 6.67 to 52.5% and reduced the mean germination time up to 4 days. The effect of flying foxes and the patas monkey on the seed germination and its implication for the African ebony plantation dynamic should be explained to communities for their conservation.",

        "abstract": "Phototaxis is a well-studied insect behaviour described as rigid and stereotyped. Larval response to light can be assessed by a fast and highly repetitive assay like a half-dark/half-illuminated plate. Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) mutants can be used to study the response of larvae to sensory stimuli. Adults of the ebony mutant show behavioural deficits such as abnormal circadian rhythms and severe defects in vision, whereas the tan mutants show a slight deficiency in vision. We analysed the response of D. melanogaster mutant larvae for N-β-alanyl derivatives metabolism (ebony and tan) to determine whether they also show abnormal phototactic behaviour. Our results showed that ebony larvae exhibited a random response to light, whereas tan larvae showed a similar response to wild-type larvae. To assess if N-β-alanyl derivatives metabolism might be involved in the response of larvae to light, we fed them with N-β-alanyldopamine (NBAD), N-β-alanylhistamine (carcinine) or dopamine. NBAD restored the wt response in ebony larvae, whereas carcinine and DA produced no effect. These results suggest, for the first time, that NBAD might act as a neuroactive compound involved in the phototactic response of the D. melanogaster larvae.",

To fill this lacuna, the present study aims to elucidate the grammatical elements of Eminem's lyrics song in the album \"The Eminem Show.\" This single case study showcased 32 lyrics song from Eminem's album with that seven grammatical features such as copula/auxiliary absence, the invariant be, the remote been, the subject verb agreement, the negation, the question formation, and the nominals. The findings found that negation is the most common grammatical features whereas the invariant be is the least common. The findings indicated that songs serve as a platform for asserting identity and criticizing diverse social, cultural, political, and economic issues. The performers are free to improvise in accordance with the tendencies and interests of the critic. Thus, the song can serve both to identify the current social crisis and as a catalyst for the crisis itself.",

        "title": "Drosophila mutants lacking the glial neurotransmitter-modifying enzyme Ebony exhibit low neurotransmitter levels and altered behavior",
        "abstract": "Inhibitors of enzymes that inactivate amine neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin), such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), are thought to increase neurotransmitter levels and are widely used to treat Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorders, yet the role of these enzymes in regulating behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated the genetic loss of a similar enzyme in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . Because the enzyme Ebony modifies and inactivates amine neurotransmitters, its loss is assumed to increase neurotransmitter levels, increasing behaviors such as aggression and courtship and decreasing sleep. Indeed, ebony mutants have been described since 1960 as \"aggressive mutants,\" though this behavior has not been quantified. Using automated machine learning-based analyses, we quantitatively confirmed that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggressive behaviors such as boxing but also decreased courtship behaviors and increased sleep. Through tissue-specific knockdown, we found that ebony ’s role in these behaviors was specific to glia. Unexpectedly, direct measurement of amine neurotransmitters in ebony brains revealed that their levels were not increased but reduced. Thus, increased aggression is the anomalous behavior for this neurotransmitter profile. We further found that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggression only when fighting each other, not when fighting wild-type controls. Moreover, fights between ebony mutants were less likely to end with a clear winner than fights between controls or fights between ebony mutants and controls. In ebony vs. control fights, ebony mutants were more likely to win. Together, these results suggest that ebony mutants exhibit prolonged aggressive behavior only in a specific context, with an equally dominant opponent.",

Despite this reality, the contribution of popular music to national discourse has not received adequate research  attention in Ghana. This paper sets out to study the lyrics of one of the songs of Ebony Reigns (Opoku-Kwarteng Priscilla), a Ghanaian musician who died few years ago. Using the womanist theory, the paper investigates how the tenets of this theory are inscribed in the song, the problems that womanism addresses in the song and their implications to the Ghanaian youth. The researchers conclude from the analysis in the paper that the youth have to use social media with caution; they need to listen to advice from the elderly in choosing life partners and the African woman needs to fight for self-expression and liberation through positive cultural means.",

Chocolate was the food that was introduced with the greatest speed in Spanish society, permeating from the elites to the popular classes. Around this delicacy there are a series of nutritional, aesthetic and sociocultural connotations that intensify it in the protagonist of many moments of daily life. At the beginning of the 17th century, Spanish artists began to make still-lifes, satisfying the demand for collecting, which was already occurring in the rest of Europe.

This article, through Antonio Pereda's Still-life with an Ebony Chest (1652), compares and analyzes the works of other masters, during the 17th and 18th centuries, who also chose this unique food as the main theme, along with its exclusive material culture that participated in commercial globalization, gestated in the Modern Age.\n El descubrimiento del Nuevo Mundo supuso una revolución gastronómica.

Therefore, additional data to enrich knowledge on the distribution, ecology, and genetics of this species is urgently needed. Furthermore, this study aimed to generate whole-genome sequencing data, including the low-coverage data for D. rumphii using MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). The sequence data generated from leaf and cambium genomic DNA was assembled to result in a draft of the chloroplast genome and constructed the phylogenetic tree based on partial nucleotide sequences of the rbcL gene. The results showed that DNA sequencing of D. rumphii generated a 3.25 Gb of long-read sequences data and a draft of a partial chloroplast genome with a size of 150,578 bp. Genetic relationship analysis using the rbcL gene showed that D. rumphii was positioned in one clade with Diospyros oblonga, which has a bootstrap value of 87% suggesting that the rbcL gene can be considered as recommended molecular marker for genetic analysis of D. rumphii in the future.",

        "abstract": "Insect body colors and patterns change markedly during development in some species as they adapt to their surroundings. The contribution of melanin and sclerotin pigments, both of which are synthesized from dopamine, to cuticle tanning has been well studied. Nevertheless, little is known about how insects alter their body color patterns. To investigate this mechanism, the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, whose body color patterns change during postembryonic development, was used as a model in this study. We focused on the ebony and tan genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis and degradation, respectively, of the precursor of yellow sclerotin N-β-alanyl dopamine (NBAD). Expression of the G. bimaculatus (Gb) ebony and tan transcripts tended to be elevated just after hatching and the molting period. We found that dynamic alterations in the combined expression levels of Gb’ebony and Gb’tan correlated with the body color transition from the nymphal stages to the adult. The body color of Gb’ebony knockout mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 systemically darkened. Meanwhile, Gb’tan knockout mutants displayed a yellow color in certain areas and stages. The phenotypes of the Gb’ebony and Gb’tan mutants probably result from an over-production of melanin and yellow sclerotin NBAD, respectively. Overall, stage-specific body color patterns in the postembryonic stages of the cricket are governed by the combinatorial expression of Gb’ebony and Gb’tan. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism by which insects evolve adaptive body coloration at each developmental stage.",

        "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant experience because it causes emotional, sensory damage and even tissue damage. Pain is sometimes termed as destructive, it can be described as a feeling such as burning, emotion, fear, nausea, a feeling of being stabbed. Pain is generally accompanied by a feeling of anxiety and a very strong desire to escape from the pain that is felt. Moreover, every feeling of pain with moderate to strong intensity is accompanied by a feeling of anxiety and a strong desire to escape from the pain experienced. Cases of pain are quite common, especially in postoperative cases, injuries, ulcer disease, cases of traffic accidents or accidents in the work environment and others. Preventive actions in the form of promotive and preventive accompanied by pain management and management are a priority. This service aims to be able to provide knowledge and understanding in terms of pain management in the Ebony room of Tora Belo Hospital, Sigi Regency. This counseling program was carried out in the Eboni room in January 2023 in the form of lectures, questions and answers and pain measurements in patients and simulations of implementing pain management. This counseling is running actively, the patient and the patient's family are very enthusiastic about listening and asking various things related to pain management that are not yet understood. Counseling given to patients is considered very effective and appropriate, thus helping patients to reduce the pain they feel. Suggestions for the next activity are to make more use of social media so that the dissemination of information is wider.",

        "abstract": "Isolation of phenolic compounds from Ebony plant leaves (Diospyros celebica Bakh .) was done by maceration technique with methanol solvent. The concentrated extract of methanol dissolved with distilled water and partition was extracted with ethyl acetate. The concentrated ethyl acetate extract dissolved with methanol solvent and partitioned with n-hexane. Then Thin layer chromatography was analyzed before column chromatography, and the eluent suitable for separation is chloroform: methanol 90:10, 80:20, 70:30,60:40,50:50 (v/v) as mobile phase. The compounds were purified with a thin layer preparative and crystallization yielding yellow paste weighing 7.5 mg with Rf = 0.45. The test purity of compounds is done by thin layer  chromatography showing a single spot with eluent chloroform: ethyl acetate (50:50) v/v and n-hexane: ethyl acetate ( 80:20) v/v. The following compound was further indicated by Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectrophotometer (FT-IR), and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonancy Spectrophotometer (1H-NMR) was estimated as a phenolic methyl gallate, phenolic acid.",

        "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation represent an important path to generate developmental differences affecting anatomical traits. Interspecific divergence in gene expression often results from changes in transcription-stimulating enhancer elements. While gene repression is crucial for precise spatiotemporal expression patterns, the relative contribution of repressive transcriptional silencers to regulatory evolution remains to be addressed. Here, we show that the Drosophila pigmentation gene ebony has mainly evolved through changes in the spatial domains of silencers patterning its abdominal expression. By precisely editing the endogenous ebony locus of D. melanogaster, we demonstrate the requirement of two redundant abdominal enhancers and three silencers that repress the redundant enhancers in a patterned manner. We observe a role for changes in these silencers in every case of ebony evolution observed to date. Our findings suggest that negative regulation by silencers likely has an under-appreciated role in gene regulatory evolution.",

        "abstract": "Every language varies and has its own characteristics. The varieties can be seen in terms of age, gender, region, social class, ethnicity, etc. One of the characteristics of a language is its grammatical features. An example of language variety that is affected by ethnic group is African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This research aimed to analyze the grammatical features of AAVE through Oscar’s utterances in Shark Tale film and the variables that influence his AAVE utterances by using Wolfram and Rickford & Rickford’s Theory. Out of four AAVE grammatical features, the researcher found that Oscar produced three of them which are verb phrase, negation, and nominal. Question formation feature is not found in Oscar’s utterances. AAVE grammatical features that appeared in Oscar’s utterances are copula/auxiliary absence, habitual be, double modals, subject-verb-agreement, ain’t, multiple negation, plural noun suffix–s deletion, and y’all. Those grammatical features are influenced by his lower working-class status, his male gender, his young age, and his mood which the AAVE utterances produced whether he was comfortable or uncomfortable with the audiences or with the topic.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate and identify the grammatical features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) used in the song lyrics of the Indonesian Rapper Ramengvrl’s album, Can’t Speak English, and understand the underlying reasons for this AAVE use by applying the language and society of sociolinguistics approach. The data was analyzed using Wolfram’s theory of classification of grammatical features of AAVE in Ramengvrl’s songs to elaborate on the purpose of its use. The data analyzed were qualitatively collected by closely and thoroughly listening to the songs and reading the transcribed lyrics. The results are as follows: Ramengvrl employs 8 out of 13 grammatical features of AAVE. Those are copula/auxiliary absence, specialized auxiliary, subject-verb agreement, negation, remote “been,” nominals, non-standard pronouns, and question formation. Furthermore, this AAVE use by Ramengvrl is because of (1) the influences of Hip-hop artists, (2) the authenticity of Hip-Hop culture, and (3) as an anti-language to represent herself. \nKeywords: African-American Vernacular English, AAVE, hip-hop, identity",

        "abstract": "Many recognize that people who buy sexual services create a demand for services that can lead to exploitation and harms to individuals and communities involved, but little research in the Canadian context has been published to understand these buyers. The present research sought to understand the attitudes of people who buy sex towards people who provide sex services by analyzing comments posted by Toronto Escort Review Board members between April 1 and October 31, 2021. A set of 15 comments were randomly selected for each of 6 searchable characteristics: “young” (age), “spinner” (body type), “ebony” (race), “trans” (gender), “submissive” (disposition), and “greek” (activity). This research reveals an attitude of consumerism in people who buy sex that leverages online communities 1) to select almost any type of person for a sexual experience and 2) get the support of fellow members to help them pursue a desired sexual experience. However, analyzed comments also suggest that members who buy sex generally ignore, consciously or unconsciously, possible exploitation or the impact on the welfare of the individual in the short and long term. Ongoing collaborations between Canadian law makers, the criminal justice system, and health and education sectors are needed to reduce the demand in sex services. This research shows there is much more work to do to confront the consumeristic views of people who provide sex services held by people who buy sex and combat online cultures that promote the exploitation of others. ",

        "abstract": "Millions of Black Americans speak a version of English not reflected in the American education system. This version of English—African American Vernacular English—is rule-governed, oral, and systematically different from the “standard” form of English (referred to as Mainstream American English from hereon) used in academic spaces. Though many young Black students enter the education system knowing African American Vernacular English, classroom instruction occurs in Mainstream American English. Black students are instructed in a language that is radically different from the one they use at home yet are expected to perform at levels similar to those of students who already speak mainstream English. This expectation contributes to the achievement gap, wherein Black students, on average, perform at lower levels than white students on evaluations in education. \nThis research, as a community-centered attempt to examine differences in literacy and achievement rates between Black and white students in America, seeks to address the achievement gap in two West Philadelphia elementary schools by leveraging the University of Pennsylvania’s resources. This paper describes my problem-solving learning research, using the Penn Reading Initiative as a vehicle for change in order to support students’ cultural and sociolinguistic backgrounds in the classroom, ideally improving literacy rates through culturally responsive pedagogy. This article lays out the problem of dialectical miscomprehension and details a solution developed alongside community members in West Philadelphia. This article also reflects on the progress made in the two years since the original research took place. It highlights the development of the Netter Center’s Professional Development Associates team and the Anti-Racism Working Group—both having been influenced by work done in this problem-solving learning framework.",

        "abstract": "Cuticle pigmentation was shown to be associated with body temperature for several relatively large species of insects, but it was questioned for small insects. Here we used a thermal camera to assess the association between drosophilid cuticle pigmentation and body temperature increase when individuals are exposed to light. We compared mutants of large effects within species ( Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow  mutants). Then we analyzed the impact of naturally occurring pigmentation variation within species complexes ( Drosophila americana/Drosophila novamexicana and Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila santomea ). Finally we analyzed lines of D. melanogaster with moderate differences in pigmentation. We found significant differences in temperatures for each of the four pairs we analyzed. The temperature differences appeared to be proportional to the differently pigmented area: between Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants or between Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana, for which the whole body is differently pigmented, the temperature difference was around 0.6 °C ± 0.2 °C. By contrast, between D. yakuba and D. santomea or between Drosophila melanogaster Dark and Pale lines, for which only the posterior abdomen is differentially pigmented, we detected a temperature difference of about 0.14 °C ± 0.10 °C. This strongly suggests that cuticle pigmentation has ecological implications in drosophilids regarding adaptation to environmental temperature.",

        "abstract": "One of the important activities to achieve the implementation of REDD+ activities is the measurement and reporting of carbon stocks (Masripatin et.al.  2010). Information on the potential for carbon stocks in a plant stand or forest area can provide an overview for related parties of the potential carbon stocks and the added value that will be obtained if it maintains and develops a certain plant species to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to determine the potential of biomass, carbon stocks, and economic valuation of the carbon stocks potential of several Ebony stands contained in the Kawanua Arboretum BP2LHK Manado.  The types of Ebony stands that were the object of this study were Dyospiros celebica, Dyospiros rumphii, and Dyospiros ebenum.  Determination of biomass potential and carbon stocks using the allometric equation.  The economic valuations of each potential carbon stocks of Ebony stands are obtained based on the selling value of carbon set by the World Bank Group. Based on the results of the study, it is known that the carbon stocks potential of each Ebony stand, namely Diospyros rumphii, is 74.246 tons/ha, followed by the potential carbon storage in the Diospyros celebica stand of 67.768 tons/ha and Diospyros ebenum of 64.977 tons / ha, while the economic valuation value of the highest carbon storage potential is found in the Diospyros rumphii stand of USD 148.492 followed by Diospyros celebica is USD 135.536 and Diospyros ebenum is USD 129.954",

These efforts can be done by preserving the durian wood by using natural preservatives, namely ebony leaves extract and soursop leaves. Ebony and soursop leaves extracts were used as natural preservatives with different concentrations using the cold soak method on durian wood. The research conducted aims to determine the effect of extract concentration on the retention of preservatives. Ebony leaves and soursop leaves were extracted by maceration method in 96% ethanol solvent for 24 hours. The durian wood sample was preserved using the cold soaking method for 1 hour using ebony leaves extract and soursop leaves extract at concentrations of 1%, 2%, and 3%. The results showed that the highest retention of preservatives from ebony leaves extract and soursop leaves extract was the use of 3% concentrations of 0.661 kg/m³ and 0.676 kg/m³, respectively. The results of the analysis of variance showed that the extract concentration had a significant effect on the retention value. The concentration of preservatives from ebony leaves extract and soursop leaves is directly proportional to the retention value of preservatives. Preservative retention of soursop leaves extract is better than ebony leaves extract.",

Our scope considered Ebony Elizabeth Thomas' (2018, 2019a, 2019b) affirmation that Black girls in imaginative settings are limited and stereotyped as much as in any other literary genre. Correspondingly, we are based on the Dark Fantastic theory established by Thomas, especially focusing on the stage of emancipation where we defend that Adeyemi’s books are grounded in Black feminist storytelling. Therefore, first, we address the ways in which qualities of innocence, goodness, beauty, and intimacy relationships are racialized as White in our society — consequently, having effects on the media and literature for the masses. Later, we analyze how the Black girl characters from Legacy of Orïsha, mainly the protagonists — Zélie and Amari —, subvert mass media and literature limitations since they are portrayed as having the qualities previously discussed alongside with their role as heroines. Finally, we assert Legacy of Orïsha can contribute to helping us rethink our collective imagination regarding Black girlhood in Speculative Fiction.",

In this text harp music is given importance. During the festive seasons the town of Bukhar is filled with songs and music. The author has explained about the seven types of musical instruments. In the text Madhavi was taught to play the harp by a musician. Madhavi learned it effectively and systematically. The text praises the merits of musical instruments. Tamil Vidu Toothu, a Tamil text states that with the help of five musical instruments such as tholkaruvi, thulaikaruvi, kanjakaruvi, narambukaruvi and midatrukaruvi 103 musical varieties are formed. Harp instruments are made using bamboo, sandal wood, charcoal, ebony and bronze. Thus, the article gives a clear information about the harp instrument.",

Fifteen plaque samples were collected from fifteen individuals with gingivitis and were sent to the laboratory for processing. Data obtained was tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis using analysis of variance and paired t-test. Bonferroni post hoc test was used to know the difference between the pairs of mouthwashes. Analysis of covariance was also done to adjust for the baseline differences. Results: The MIC of Group I, Group II and Group III mouthwashes ranged 0.8 µg/ml-12.5 µg/ml, 0.4 µg/ml-25 µg/ml and 0.4 µg/ml-25 µg/ml, respectively, against the tested bacterial strains. Group I and Group II mouthwashes did exhibit antibacterial activity. However, the antibacterial efficacy of herbal mouthwashes exhibited significant differences when compared with Chlorhexidine. Conclusion: Group I and Group II mouthwashes showed antibacterial activity. However, these herbal mouthwashes showed less antibacterial action when compared to Group III.",

        "abstract": "Cuticle pigmentation has been clearly demonstrated to impact body temperature for several relatively large species of insects, but it was questioned for small insects. Here we used a thermal camera to assess the impact of drosophilid cuticle pigmentation on body temperature when individuals are exposed to light. We compared mutants of large effects within species (Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants). Then we analyzed the impact of naturally occurring pigmentation variation within species complexes (Drosophila americana/Drosophila novamexicana and Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila santomea). Finally we analyzed lines of D. melanogaster with moderate differences in pigmentation. We found significant differences in temperatures for each of the four pairs we analyzed. The temperature differences appeared to be proportional to the differently pigmented area: between Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants or between Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana, for which the whole body is differently pigmented, the difference in temperatures was around 0.6°C ±0.2°C. By contrast, between D. yakuba and D. santomea or between Drosophila melanogaster Dark and Pale lines, for which only the posterior abdomen is differentially pigmented, we detected a temperature difference of about 0.14°C ±0.10°C. This demonstrates that cuticle pigmentation has ecological implications in drosophilids regarding adaptation to environmental temperature.",

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Insect cuticle coloration results from pigments accumulating in a species-specific pattern. Numerous genes are involved in regulating pigmentation, and their manipulation can be used to create externally visible markers of successful gene editing. To clarify the roles for many of these genes and examine their suitability as markers in Lygus hesperus Knight (western tarnished plant bug), we screened existing gene expression data for sequences similar to those with known functions in pigmentation. We identified six genes (aaNAT, black, ebony, pale, tan, and yellow), with two variants for black and found that expression varied for each by developmental stage, adult age, body part, and sex. Silencing the expression of each gene produced varied effects in adults, ranging from the non-detectable (black 1, yellow), to moderate decreases (pale, tan) and increases (black 2, ebony) in darkness, to extremely dark and pervasive pigmentation (aaNAT). Based solely on its expression profile and easily observed color changes, aaNAT appears to be the best marker for tracking transgenic L. hesperus. Abstract Cuticle coloration in insects is a consequence of the accumulation of pigments in a species-specific pattern. Numerous genes are involved in regulating the underlying processes of melanization and sclerotization, and their manipulation can be used to create externally visible markers of successful gene editing. To clarify the roles for many of these genes and examine their suitability as phenotypic markers in Lygus hesperus Knight (western tarnished plant bug), transcriptomic data were screened for sequences exhibiting homology with the Drosophila melanogaster proteins. Complete open reading frames encoding putative homologs for six genes (aaNAT, black, ebony, pale, tan, and yellow) were identified, with two variants for black. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses supported preliminary annotations as cuticle pigmentation genes. In accord with observable difference in color patterning, expression varied for each gene by developmental stage, adult age, body part, and sex. Knockdown by injection of dsRNA for each gene produced varied effects in adults, ranging from the non-detectable (black 1, yellow), to moderate decreases (pale, tan) and increases (black 2, ebony) in darkness, to extreme melanization (aaNAT). Based solely on its expression profile and highly visible phenotype, aaNAT appears to be the best marker for tracking transgenic L. hesperus.",

As CITES convenes its 19th Conference of the Parties in November 2022, some of the largest seizures in history of illegally harvested CITES-listed species are poised to be handed back to the criminals who smuggled them out of Madagascar. Nearly 40,000 rosewood logs were illegally exported from the country in 2014, in clear violation of CITES and national embargos, as explicitly declared in Notices issued by the CITES Secretariat. The logs were seized by Singapore, Kenya, and Sri Lanka, but as a result of both passive and active interference from various Malagasy officials and aggressive use of these countries’ national court and political systems, orders have now been issued for the logs to be returned to the smugglers. Release of this wood would have catastrophic consequences for the future sustainable management of Madagascar’s remaining rosewood and ebony resources. We propose five essential steps that should be taken at the upcoming CITES CoP 19 in Panama to prevent this from happening.",

The initial moisture content of mahogany and ebony blanks was determined according to GOST 16588. The control over the current moisture content was carried out by the method of control samples. And the development of drying stresses is based on power samples. The stresses arising during the drying of the workpieces were evaluated by the relative deformation of the power sections teeth, sawn from the control power samples.

        "abstract": "Three hair dyes of Arianor madder red 306003 (R), Arian or Straw Yellow 306005 (Y), and Arianor ebony 306020 (E) were removed from an aqueous solution in a batch mode using a powder of oak cupules coated with ZnO (COZ). The COZ-adsorbent material was characterized in terms of XRD, FT-IR, and SEM analysis. The best conditions for the uptake of hair dyes by COZ were investigated. For Y dye, the best uptake was estimated on 0.06 g of COZ at 7.0 pH for 150 min. The E dye uptake requires 120 min on 0.05 g of COZ at 9.0 pH. For E hair dye, kinetic data revealed a pseudo-first-order model for E hair dye and a pseudo-second-order model for R and Y. Equilibrium data exhibited consistency with the Langmuir isotherm model for the adsorption of E dye onto COZ, and the Freundlich isotherm model for the adsorption of R and Y hair dyes onto COZ. Isotherms models of D-R and Temkin were also examined. The thermodynamic parameters (−ve ∆G and +ve ∆H and ∆S) demonstrated that the removal of hair dyes by COZ is spontaneous, endothermic, and feasible. The adsorption capacity of COZ for R, Y, and E uptake was found to be 55.5, 52.6, and 135.1 mg·g−1, respectively. Furthermore, COZ reusability was demonstrated after five cycles of regeneration, with a negligible decline in adsorption extent (13.08%, 13.85, and 10.20% for R, Y, and E, respectively) in comparison to its initial capacity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Karyanto P, Bagasta AR, Nayasilana IN, Nor SMD, Atmoko SSU, Susilowati A, Sunarto 2022. Next generation sequencing reveals plants consumed by the vulnerable ebony langur (Trachypithecus auratus) in a fragmented mountain forest. Biodiversitas 23: 4759-4769. Many mountain forests on Java Island have suffered from forest degradation, fragmentation, and alien species invasion that cause a significant change in vegetation structure. This changing floristic structure may affect the foraging substrate of the foliage eater ebony langur, Trachypithecus auratus. Hence, ascertaining the plants eaten by the langur may contribute significantly to informing important ecological data about its foraging adaptation and conservation. We analyzed six fecal samples of the langur from three forest sites in Mount Merbabu National Park, Indonesia. This research used the plant mini barcode to sequence the ribulose-biphosphate carboxylase gene (rbcl) in the mitochondrial DNA of the plants eaten by the langur using the Next Generation Sequencing. We compare the NGS results to floristic reference data from a vegetation survey preceding the fecal analysis. The NGS found 238 OTUs that belong to 32 taxa. Most of the langur’s diet belongs to the lower crop community. The study’s results suggest that the ebony langur’s dietary composition shows an adaptation to the new floristic composition. However, since the habitat is continuously degraded, the stakeholders must perform appropriate home-building-based habitat management practices to conserve this vulnerable species.",

        "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation represent an important path to generate developmental differences affecting anatomical traits. Interspecific divergence in gene expression often results from changes in transcription-stimulating enhancer elements. While gene repression is crucial for precise spatiotemporal expression patterns, the relative contribution of repressive transcriptional silencer to regulatory evolution remains to be addressed. Here, we show that the Drosophila pigmentation gene ebony has mainly evolved through changes in the spatial domains of silencers patterning its abdominal expression. By precisely editing the endogenous ebony locus of D. melanogaster, we demonstrate the requirement of two redundant abdominal enhancers and three silencers that repress the redundant enhancers in a patterned manner. We observe a role for changes in these silencers in every case of ebony evolution observed to date. Our findings suggest that negative regulation by silencers likely has an under-appreciated role in gene regulatory evolution.",

        "abstract": "Embedding melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin-coated shellac microcapsules in waterborne coatings can extend the service longevity of waterborne coatings on a wood surface to a certain extent. Due to the content limitation of self-repairing microcapsules in waterborne coatings, the effective self-healing performance time is short. With the aim of improving the self-repairing properties of self-repairing coatings on the surface of a Microberlinla sp substrate, a more effective self-healing mechanism was achieved by impregnating the ebony wood substrate several times with an MF resin-coated transparent shellac-rosin microcapsule emulsion. After the impregnation of the ebony boards with microcapsules, a waterborne acrylic resin coating containing 3.0 wt.% transparent shellac microcapsules was applied to the surface of the wood boards. The influence of the number impregnations on the surface coating’s physical properties, chemical properties, and self-repairing properties was explored. The results showed that the hardness of the surface coating on the ebony boards changed little under different numbers of impregnations. With the increasing number of impregnations, the surface coatings’ adhesion and impact strength slowly increased, the chromatic difference value was increased, and the roughness first increased and then decreased. Impregnating ebony boards with the microcapsule emulsion contributes to enhancing the aging resistance and repair performance of surface coatings on the ebony boards. When the number of impregnations was eight, the width change rate of cracks on surface self-healing coatings was 28.4%, which suggested the best repair performance among all samples. By impregnating the wood substrate with the self-healing microcapsule emulsion, the effect of the interaction between microcapsules and wood on the self-repairing properties of the surface coating was studied, contributing to the theory for further improving the self-repairing properties of waterborne coatings on wood surfaces and promoting the application and development of self-healing microcapsules.",

        "abstract": "Hans-Jürgen Massaquoi’s (1926-2013) autobiography Destined to Witness. Growing up Black in Nazi Germany (1999) appeared simultaneously in German translation as Neger, Neger, Schornsteinfeger. Meine Kindheit in Deutschland (1999, 2006 as a film). The bestseller recounts Massaquoi’s birth in 1926 at Hamburg as a biracial child of a German mother and a black father from Liberia who returns to Africa leaving his wife and Afro-German son to fend for themselves in a working-class neighborhood. Their struggle to survive Nazi Germany is described in numerous small chapters that are informed by the journalistic as well as literary style that Massaquoi became accustomed to once he became established in the United States as managing editor of the African American magazine Ebony. The book is replete with proverbs and proverbial expressions that add metaphorical expressiveness to this emotional and informative account of survival among prejudice, stereotypes, and racism. Many of the proverbs, often quoted by Massaquoi’s mother, are cited in German with English translations or only in English. Thus the book is a telling example of how proverbs function in a family and beyond as social strategies to carve out a marginalized existence between 1926 and the early 1950s in Germany, Liberia, and the United States. Numerous contextualized references are cited, and there is also a large index of 509 (645 counting 136 duplicates) proverbial texts",

        "abstract": "Johnson Publishing Company, the publisher of Negro Digest and Ebony, made efforts to expand its white audience during the 1940s and early 1950s. Johnson Publishing aggressively sought “to sell white readers the idea that a Negro magazine is worth buying,” through the regular publication of letters from “white” readers, consistent references to its influence among whites, fundraising and subscription drives to circulate its magazines among white readers and within white institutions, advertising campaigns in major national publications, and other projects and editorial content. This study argues that these efforts can be situated within both a longer history of white readership of Black periodicals and are connected to a broader turn toward Black literature by white Americans during—and immediately following—World War II. In doing so, Johnson was able to position his publications as both recognizably Black periodicals and the “interracial magazine[s] that America needs.”",

        "abstract": "Since her debut in Paris in 1925 and meteoric rise to stardom, views of Josephine Baker have been dominated by the white artists and audiences who constructed her as an exotic “Other”. This article revisits the phenomenon of “La Bakaire” from the perspective of a Black female artist who witnessed her performance first-hand and participated in the same Jazz Age projects of fashioning New Negro womanhood and formulating Black Deco aesthetics. When Gwendolyn Bennett saw Baker perform, she recognized her as a familiar model of selfhood, fellow artist, and member of a diasporic Black cultural community. In her article “Let’s Go: In Gay Paree”, July 1926 Opportunity cover, and “Ebony Flute” column, she utilizes call and response patterns to transform racialized sexual objectification into collective affirmation of Black female beauty and artistry. The picture that emerges from Bennett’s art and writing is one of communal practices and interartistic expression, in which Baker joins a host of now-forgotten chorus girls, vaudeville actors, jazz singers, musicians, visual artists, and writers participating in a modern renaissance of Black expressive culture.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of Batesian mimicry – whereby harmless species avoid predation through their resemblance to harmful species – has long intrigued biologists. In rare cases, such mimicry systems can be highly dynamic, being maintained via frequency-dependent selection on intraspecific polymorphisms, in which only some individuals within a population resemble a noxious ‘model’. Here, we use genomic approaches to identify the genetic basis of a striking mimicry polymorphism within a widespread New Zealand stonefly complex. Specifically, highly melanised specimens of Zelandoperla closely resemble an aposematic stonefly (Austroperla cyrene) well-known for its production of hydrogen cyanide. We assess convergence in the colour pattern of these two species, compare their relative palatability to predators, and use genome-wide association mapping to elucidate the genetic basis of this mimicry polymorphism. Our analysis reveals that melanised Zelandoperla overlap significantly with Austroperla in colour space, but are significantly more palatable to predators, indicating that they are indeed Batesian mimics. Analysis of 194,773 genome-wide SNPs reveals a strong outlier locus (ebony) differentiating melanic (mimic) versus non-melanic phenotypes. As ebony has a well-documented role in insect melanin biosynthesis, our findings highlight its conserved function across deeply divergent hexapod lineages. Distributional records suggest a link between the occurrence of Zelandoperla mimics and forested ecosystems where the model Austroperla is abundant, suggesting the potential for adaptive shifts in this system underpinned by environmental change.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Asobara japonica is an endoparasitic wasp that parasitizes Drosophila flies. It synthesizes various toxic components in the venom gland and injects them into host larvae during oviposition. To identify and characterize these toxic components for enabling parasitism, we performed the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and devised a protocol for RNA interference (RNAi) with A. japonica. Because it has a parthenogenetic lineage due to Wolbachia infection, we generated a clonal strain from a single wasp to obtain highly homogenous genomic DNA. The WGS analysis revealed that the estimated genome size was 322 Mb with a heterozygosity of 0.132%. We also performed RNA-seq analyses for gene annotation. Based on the qualified WGS platform, we cloned ebony-Aj, which encodes the enzyme N-β-alanyl dopamine synthetase, which is involved in melanin production. The microinjection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting ebony-Aj led to body colour changes in adult wasps, phenocopying ebony-Dm mutants. Furthermore, we identified putative venom genes as a target of RNAi, confirming that dsRNA injection-based RNAi specifically suppressed the expression of the target gene in wasp adults. Taken together, our results provide a powerful genetic toolkit for studying the molecular mechanisms of parasitism.",

        "abstract": "\n\nEbony (Diospyros spp.) is a fancy wood distributed in eastern Indonesia. D. celebica Bakh, D. lolin Bakh, D. pilosanthera Blanco, D. ebenum Koenig, D. ferrea (Wild.) Bakh and D. rumphii Bakh are categorized as “Fancy Wood Class I” in the Indonesian market. These woods are an important product with the highest tax compared to other grades. This study aimed to identify the distribution of six ebonies based on data global biodiversity web service (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and their climatic condition based on global climate data (WorldClim). Data from the web service, species occurrence, and climatic conditions were processed using QGIS. Species occurrence data was then extracted using GBIF occurrence. Furthermore, species occurrence data was then overlaid with climate data using point sampling tools. The results found that three ebonies scattered in the tropics and three others (D. celebica Bakh, D. rumphii Bakh, D. lolin Bakh) mostly occurred in Indonesia. Annual rainfall and temperature conditions ranged from 1,722 – 4,013 mm and 23.4 – 27.2°C for the three species of ebony in Indonesia. The distribution and climatic conditions of ebony are the initial information for further research, such as the species distribution model related to climate change and the genetic conservation agenda.\nKeywords: ebony, global data, occurrence data, precipitation, temperature\n\n",

        "abstract": "Interesting morphological traits in tree organs are essential for selecting the best plant germplasm. Variation in morphometric traits of leaf, fruit and seed of multipurpose tree Diospyros mespiliformis were studied in two climatic zones in Benin using 735 trees from 4 major habitats (provenances) in each climatic zone. Morphological trait measurements were combined with architectural parameters and analyzed using two-way ANOVA, principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering. Results indicated that significant differences were observed between leaves, fruits and seed morphological traits within climatic zones and habitats in terms of dimensions across the study area. Compared to the other three habitats (low dimensions), leaves from woodland showed large dimensions (µL_leaf=130 mm, µl_leaf=50 mm). Soudano Guinean zone recorded the highest fruits morphological traits values (µd_fruit= 36 mm µl_fruit=30 mm) while Soudanian zone had the lowest (µd_fruit= 12 mm, µl_fruit=8 mm). More seeds per fruit were recorded in woodlands and parklands. Out of these, hierarchical analysis grouped ebony morphotypes into four clusters. There was no significant correlation between the number of seeds per fruits and other fruit traits. However, significant and strong positive correlations were found between morphometric characters, bearing and architectural parameters (R = 0.96). The provenance significantly affected variations in organ-related traits. Correlation relationships suggested morphotypes for breeding improvement. Interesting and desired characteristics delineating individuals and populations can guide future selection of targeted ebony trees with the aim of improving high-value species in agroforestry domestication program.",

        "abstract": "The use of dental implants in oral rehabilitations has become increasingly common, thanks to the safety and predictability of these rehabilitations. Unfortunately, dental implants, being alloplastic devices, are not free from biomechanical complications, especially in the case in which the connections are complex and involve several components. The aim of the study is to highlight what could be surface alterations using different screwing torques, or by repeating the screwing process several times. In this study, 40 passant screws (Osstem®, South Korea Dental Implant Ebony Gold®) were examined under a Zeiss EVO LS 10 scanning electron microscope (SEM), operating with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Passant screws were subdivided into 4 groups: 30 Nmm tightening torque; maximum tightening torque; 2 times 30 Nmm tightening torque; no screwing, new ones (control group). There are no significant differences in the surfaces of the passant screws in SEM images, and the 100% of the passant screws is free of defects or fractures. Surely, further studies and investigations will certainly be needed to allow improvement of these devices.",

        "abstract": "The present Bayelsa State, Nigeria was part of the Niger Delta region, described by the Henry Willink Commission (HWC) report as “poor, backward and neglected” in 1958; and urged the federal government to establish an agency to develop the area/people. The people never wanted an agency, rather a state; and when the agency – Niger Delta Development Board was established in 1961, it couldn’t develop the area. This prompted perennial agitations until Bayelsa state was created, along with 5 others – Ebony, Ekiti, Gombe, Katsina and Zamfara (BEE-GKZ) in 1996. After 24 years, the area is still least developed, even within the 6 states; and the problem was traced to bad leadership (i.e., governors). Thus, the study aimed at interrogating the nexus between leadership and sustainable development (SD), as well as, comparing and contrasting the level of SD with the other 5 states on 6 critical indices developed by the researchers between 1999 and 2020. It adopted the ‘CAABA model’ of development, along with the “people – task orientation leadership” of the Michigan Studies in 1950 as theoretical frameworks; and applied a combination of descriptive survey and historical design of data collection. The instruments containing 3 questions were given to scholars/experts in the Niger Delta University for face and construct validity, and subjected to reliability test. Data was presented in table and analysed in qualitative and quantitative formats; and the study recommended some drastic improvements in the recruitment processes of political executives (governors) by political parties and Nigerians by insisting on strict adherence to guidelines on internal democracy during party primaries. The implication is that without improvement, the political executives shall ‘drag’ Nigeria to become a ‘failed state’.",

        "abstract": "Este artículo ofrece una investigación sobre la traducción subtitulada al español de la variante dialectal African American Vernacular English (AAVE) y para su ilustración se emplean ejemplos de la serie estadounidense The Wire. En primer lugar, se analiza la vital importancia que cobra el AAVE (además de otras variedades dialectales como el bawlmer, propio de Baltimore) en el desarrollo de la serie, hasta el punto que, sin estas variedades lingüísticas el programa televisivo perdería buena parte de su bien construida esencia. A continuación, se trata desde una perspectiva teórica cómo afrontar los múltiples problemas de la traducción dialectal de The Wire; para ello, se emplea la tipología propuesta de Marco Borillo (2002), que, posteriormente, nos ayuda a analizar algunos rasgos léxicos y morfosintácticos propios del AAVE y su posterior traducción al español. Estos rasgos seleccionados se ilustran con diferentes ejemplos de diálogos de la primera temporada de la serie, en los que se coteja la versión original inglesa con la traducción oficial al español del canal televisivo HBO. Todas estas ilustraciones vienen acompañadas de unas propuestas de traducción subtitulada alternativas a la versión oficial, cuya finalidad es ayudar a obtener en la versión española un tono lingüístico similar al de la versión inglesa.   ",

The objective of this research was to separate and identify putatively metabolite present in the leaves and wood of ebony across Sulawesi. Separation and identification of ebony metabolites were carried out using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis. Using ultrasonication with ethanol as the extracting solvent, we used powdered ebony leaves and wood. The results showed that the metabolites contained in the leaves and wood of ebony were 59 metabolites. About 14 compounds were found in the leaves and wood, 21 compounds in the wood, and 24 compounds in the leaves. The identified metabolites are flavonoids, terpenoids, amino aldehydes, alkaloids, quinones, steroids, amino acids, fatty acids, and saccharides. Clustering of ebony using principal component analysis obtained leaves and wood groups using peak area of known compounds as the variable.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, we examine how humor practices on Twitter resist dominant emotion norms during an emerging disease outbreak. Humor may seem frivolous or irreverent but can constitute a powerful practice for channeling and managing difficult emotions – like anxiety and fear – during an outbreak. We find that the use of AAVE (African-American Vernacular English) and Black cultural references were widespread in Ebola-related tweets using humor. Together these communicative practices constitute Black Twitter. Humor can signal membership in Black culture while also performing and managing specific emotions in relation to epidemic risk in online spaces. Humor practices on Black Twitter were more likely to reimagine social connections despite the risks posed by the epidemic, whereas mainstream forms of humor emphasized retreat and self-isolation in response to an epidemic threat. These findings center the agency and creativity of this influential digital community while showing the variability of communication practices among a group facing disproportionate vulnerability to outbreaks and public health threats. The implications for public health messaging are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Mainstream feminism has remained an elitist concept in India with much less attention and significance in comparison to the feminism conception in western countries. The Indian feminist movement failed to represent the perspectives of the Dalit women that have been subjected in the Indian society since ages. Subsequently, the Dalit women were forced to initiate a separate movement to gain sustenance and representation in the mainstream social conduct. The theoretical representations of the Dalit women could also be drawn from American and African literature that shares experiences of Dalit feminism and subjection on a broader scale. Further, the research reflects Dalit feminism in terms of inclusive feminism that confronts domination of female community in India and elsewhere. Considering the Dalit woman’s writing, the glimpses can be found in the Indian vernaculars in the form of short stories. It is present in the form of Telugu Dalit writing that have been translated into English to reflect the perceptions of the Dalit women and their experiences in Indian discourse.",

        "abstract": "N-β-alanyldopamine (NBAD) is a precursor of N-acylquinone sclerotin utilized for cross-linking between cuticular proteins for cuticle during insect molting. The importance of NBAD in cuticle tanning has not been well compared among different developing stages of insects. Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata, a typical polyphagous pest feeding on a large number of Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae plants in Asian countries, displays diverse cuticle pigmentation patterns among developing stages and body regions. Here, we found that the expression of three genes (Hvadc, Hvebony, and Hvtan) involved in NBAD biosynthesis peaked in the 4-day-old pupae or 0-day-old adults of H. vigintioctopunctata. At the first, second, third, and fourth larval instar and pupal stage, their transcript levels were high just before and/or right after the molting. Moreover, they were more abundantly transcribed at the larval heads than in the bodies. RNA interference (RNAi) of either Hvadc or Hvebony at the third instar larvae selectively deepened the color of the larval head capsules, antennae, mouthpart, scoli, strumae, and legs; and depletion of the two genes blackened the pupal head capsules, antennae, mouthpart, and legs. However, the knockdown of either Hvadc or Hvebony darkened the whole bodies of the adults. Conversely, RNAi of Hvtan at the third instar stage had little influence on the pigmentation in the larvae, pupae, and adults. These findings demonstrated that Adc and Ebony are important in cuticle pigmentation of H. vigintioctopunctata and suggested that larger quantities of NBAD were present in adults and play more important roles in pigmentation than larvae/pupae.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is essential to ensure robust phenotypic outcomes. Pigmentation patterns in Drosophila are determined by pigments biosynthesized in the developing epidermis and the cis-regulatory elements of the genes involved in this process are well-characterized. Here, we report that the known primary epidermal enhancer is dispensable for the transcriptional activation of ebony (involved in light-colored pigment synthesis) in the developing epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. The evidence was obtained by introducing an approximately 1 kbp deletion at the primary epidermal enhancer by genome editing. The effect of the primary epidermal enhancer deletion on pigmentation and on the endogenous expression pattern of a mCherry-fused ebony allele was examined in the abdomen. The expression levels of the mCherry-fused ebony in the primary epidermal enhancer-deleted strains were slightly higher than that of the control strain, indicating that the sequences outside the primary epidermal enhancer have an ability to drive an expression of this gene in the epidermis. Interestingly, the primary epidermal enhancer deletion resulted in a derepression of this gene in the dorsal midline of the abdominal tergites, where dark pigmentation is present in the wild-type individuals. This indicated that the primary epidermal enhancer fragment contains a silencer. Furthermore, the endogenous expression pattern of ebony in the 2 additional strains with partially deleted primary epidermal enhancer revealed that the silencer resides within a 351-bp fragment in the 5' portion of the primary epidermal enhancer. These results demonstrated that deletion assays combined with reporter assays are highly effective in detecting the presence of positively and negatively regulating sequences within and outside the focal cis-regulatory elements.",

A noção de currículo, segundo Marlucy Paraíso, articulada com a diáspora dos povos africanos, na leitura de Paul Gilroy, pavimentam o estudo que propõe uma aproximação entre experiências pessoais descritas por Hall, Ebony Thomas e o autor deste artigo, para perceber o Afrofuturismo como uma alternativa para a construção de formas de currículo para o Lazer, as quais, ao invés de aprisionar, reativem forças, comprometendo-se com as relações étnico-raciais.",

        "abstract": "Tracing across the complex histories of dominions and influences converging on the Caribbean territories, this paper examines certain common historic threads that persisted into the contemporary Caribbean cultural landscape and its architecture. As the largest English Caribbean island, Jamaica had one hundred and sixty-one years (1494–1655) of Spanish governance; and in the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad had two hundred and ninety-nine years (1498–1797). Drawing evidence from sixteenth- to mid-nineteenth-century archival iconography and documentation across the wider Americas, this paper identifies and discusses a common Caribbean urban and rural cultural landscape. By the 1834 English emancipation declaration from enslavement, this landscape acquired architectural syncretism at the encounter between the Indigenous buhio, or bohio, and the arrival of Columbus in 1492. This encounter has since then propelled creole and vernacular manifestations of distinct architectural forms from Indigenous, European, and African peoples across the period of plantation enslavement. Gottfried Semper displayed a Caribbean ‘hut’ from the island of Trinidad at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, extending the syncretic manifestation from the ‘primitive hut’ architectural treatise to the birth of modern architecture. While ascribing the roots of these styles to Caribbean traditional architecture, this paper demonstrates the value of such architectonic syncretism and the connection with the development of modern architecture, and furthermore, the agenda of sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "Dramatic monologue had been used as a powerful tool to express emotions and feelings through the characters in the ancient Greek drama. It received the proper recognition in the Victorian era as a new form of literary device when the various poets and writers started using it in their works. Edgar Allan Poe was not an exceptional. This article explores the language of dramatic monologue in Edgar Allan Poe’s poem “The Raven”. It aims to look at the poem through the three perceptible features of the dramatic monologue: speaker/narrator, audience/listener, and occasion. It examines how the speaker’s soliloquy speech–moaning for the loss of his wife–changes into a powerful dramatic monologue. Obsessed with pain and agony, the speaker’s dramatic monologue escalates finding a listener, ebony raven inside the room. Throughout the poem, the occasion of the cold December becomes the vital point to bestow cryptic feelings to readers. In addition, the article provides an analysis of poetic structures through figurative languages which have made the poem pedagogically rich and their impact has taken the speaker’s dramatic monologue in diﬀerent level.",

This research was conducted in the Tombolo Resort Balocci Forest Area of Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park in South Sulawesi Province. Data collection is carried out in a plot measuring 100 m x 100 m divided into 100 subplots measuring 10m x 10m, covering the individual number of trees and the area of the base field on each research sub-plot. Microhabitat factors include pH, marbles, soil depth, header closure, and the proportion of sub-plot surfaces covered in outcropping stones. The results showed that (1) the pattern of ebony distribution at the location of this study is clustered, (2) the correlation value of pH and density shows a negative and insignificant relationship (p>0.05), the correlation of marbles with density shows a positive and significant value (p<0.05), the closing correlation of the header, the depth of the soil with a positive but insignificant density (p> 0.05), while the correlation of the proportion of sub-plot surfaces covered in outcrops and densities showed a negative but significant relationship (p<0.05), (3) the correlation value of pH with negative and insignificant dominance (p>0.05), the correlation of the proportion of outcrop stones with negative and significant dominance (p<0.05), the correlation of heading closure, marbles with positive and significant dominance (p<00.05), soil depth correlation and positive but non-significant dominance (p> 0.05).",

Se observa cómo el texto fuente, mediante la técnica de «dialecto visual», refleja en la página impresa algunos de los rasgos fonológicos y morfosintácticos del inglés afroamericano con fines paródicos. Se analiza qué estrategias se han seguido para verter al texto meta el dialecto de Ebony White en los cómics publicados por Norma y traducidos por Enrique Sánchez Abulí. \nEste estudio contrastivo indaga en cómo Sánchez Abulí juega con la ortografía y opone las intervenciones del protagonista a las de Ebony White, que habla una variedad ficticia de español no estándar.

Considering the importance of songs, this study sought to analyze ambiguity in Ghanaian songs focusing on songs produced by one of the vibrant production houses in Ghana ‘Ruff town Records’. The study was based on 15 sampled songs by Ebony Reigns and Wendy Shay, the leading artistes of the record label. The study revealed instances of ambiguity in 10 of the sampled songs with the causes of these indeterminacies being mainly phonological intonation and lexical choices. These ambiguities were euphemistically deployed mostly to highlight sexual images. The study has implications for revealing the trends and patterns of contemporary Ghanaian music. It is therefore recommended that more studies should be carried out on Ghanaian songs, focusing on other styles and presentation techniques employed by song writers.",

        "abstract": "The traits of two subspecies of western honey bees, Apis mellifera scutellata and A.m. capensis, endemic to the Republic of South Africa (RSA), are of biological and commercial relevance. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of important phenotypes found in these subspecies remains poorly understood. We performed a genome wide association study on three traits of biological relevance in 234 A.m. capensis, 73 A.m. scutellata and 158 hybrid individuals. Thirteen markers were significantly associated to at least one trait (P ≤ 4.28 × 10−6): one for ovariole number, four for scutellar plate and eight for tergite color. We discovered two possible causative variants associated to the respective phenotypes: a deletion in GB46429 or Ebony (NC_007070.3:g.14101325G>del) (R69Efs*85) and a nonsense on GB54634 (NC_007076.3:g.4492792A>G;p.Tyr128*) causing a premature stop, substantially shortening the predicted protein. The mutant genotypes are significantly associated to phenotypes in A.m. capensis. Loss-of-function of Ebony can cause accumulation of circulating dopamine, and increased dopamine levels correlate to ovary development in queenless workers and pheromone production. Allelic association (P = 1.824 x 10−5) of NC_007076.3:g.4492792A>G;p.Tyr128* to ovariole number warrants further investigation into function and expression of the GB54634 gene. Our results highlight genetic components of relevant production/conservation behavioral phenotypes in honey bees.",

        "abstract": "\n Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) are important pollinators and will selectively forage on crepe myrtle (CM) during the summer months. Unfortunately, CM pollen can become contaminated with pesticides used to control insects, especially crepe myrtle bark scale (Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae Kuwana). An experiment was conducted in July and August of 2019 and 2020 to compare honeybee visits to CM among four cultivars (‘Natchez', ‘Tuscarora', ‘Ebony Fire', and ‘Pocomoke') at an isolated location, and within a single cultivar series (Ebony) near other pollinator-friendly plants. ‘Natchez' had the most honeybee visits per tree, averaging 1.4 visits per 75 seconds per tree per day in 2019 and 1.2 visits per 75 seconds per tree per day in 2020, followed by ‘Tuscarora' with 0.8 and 0.4 honeybee visits per 75 seconds per tree per day, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2020, there was a significant, moderate correlation (P< 0.001, r = 0.51) between bloom number and honeybee visits, with ‘Natchez' (158.9) and ‘Tuscarora' (148.2) having more average blooms per tree than ‘Ebony Fire' (35.6) and ‘Pocomoke' (35.7). Landscape environment and proximity to pollinator-friendly plants did not affect honeybee visits. CM are an important foraging resource for honeybees in the summer, and honeybees have a strong preference for cultivars with large, productive bloom clusters.\n Index words: pollinators, crepe myrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae, crepe myrtle\n Species used in this study: Crepe myrtle, Lagerstroemia indica L.; Lagerstroemia × faurei; Honeybee, Apis mellifera L.; American bumblebee, Bombus pensylvanicus De Geer.",

        "abstract": "Automated speech recognition (ASR) converts language into text and is used across a variety of applications to assist us in everyday life, from powering virtual assistants, natural language conversations, to enabling dictation services. While recent work suggests that there are racial disparities in the performance of ASR systems for speakers of African American Vernacular English, little is known about the psychological and experiential effects of these failures paper provides a detailed examination of the behavioral and psychological consequences of ASR voice errors and the difficulty African American users have with getting their intents recognized. The results demonstrate that ASR failures have a negative, detrimental impact on African American users. Specifically, African Americans feel othered when using technology powered by ASR—errors surface thoughts about identity, namely about race and geographic location—leaving them feeling that the technology was not made for them. As a result, African Americans accommodate their speech to have better success with the technology. We incorporate the insights and lessons learned from sociolinguistics in our suggestions for linguistically responsive ways to build more inclusive voice systems that consider African American users’ needs, attitudes, and speech patterns. Our findings suggest that the use of a diary study can enable researchers to best understand the experiences and needs of communities who are often misunderstood by ASR. We argue this methodological framework could enable researchers who are concerned with fairness in AI to better capture the needs of all speakers who are traditionally misheard by voice-activated, artificially intelligent (voice-AI) digital systems.",

        "abstract": "Eboni (Diospyros celebica Bakh.) is an endemic tree species of Sulawesi Island including Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi and South Sulawesi. This species is also called fancy wood; its color is black-striped reddish brown, beautiful, and luxurious. In addition, tree growth is influenced by microbes, including fungi. Fungi are heterotrophic and eukaryotic organisms absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. The study aimed to identify ebony-associated fungi in Urban Forestry at the Tamalanrea Campus, Hasanuddin University, Makassar, Indonesia. This study consisted of the isolation stage both direct and dilution methods, the rejuvenation stage, and fungal identification. The study result indicated that there were 60 fungal isolates isolated from the ebony tree tissues, while 19 fungal isolates were isolated on the soil under the ebony stands. The direct isolation-based method was higher in term of number of fungal isolates than the dilution-based method. The isolated fungi belonged to the seven genera, namely Aspergillus, Penicillium, Gliocladium, Trichoderma, Fusarium, Rhizopus, and Phytophthora. Aspergillus and Penicillium was genera dominated both in tree tissues and in the soil under ebony stands.",

        "abstract": "The population of ebony trees in Sulawesi has decreased and has been included in Appendix II Cites, which means it can only be traded based on quotas. Insect studies on ebony stands are still limited, especially in South Sulawesi. This study aims to determine the diversity and association of ebony with insects found in ebony stands in the Hasanuddin University Education Forest, Maros Regency. This activity was carried out in June 2021. Sampling was carried out using the light trap method for winged insects with nocturnal activity and pitfall traps for insects crawling on the ground. Data analysis to determine the diversity of insect species was carried out using the Shannon-Wiener (H') species and the Margalef index. The results showed that the insects found were 8 orders, 20 families, and 28 species from 128 individuals. Based on analysis of their functional role, the insect complexes consist of 34% herbivores, 50% predators, 8% parasitoids, 14% detritivores and 2% transient species. The diversity of species was classified as moderate, namely 2.71, while the richness index value of 5.56, which was classified as high richness in Ebony Stands.",

        "title": "Painted Portraits and Androgynous Apparitions in the Haunted-Portrait Narratives of Vernon Lee and E. Nesbit",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s dramatic monologue “The Portrait” (1870) begins with an elegiac lament from an artist, gazing upon a portrait of his dead beloved: “This is her image as she was:/It seems a thing to wonder on,/As though mine image in a glass/Should tarry when myself am gone.” 1 Rossetti’s verse not only preserves the image of a dead beloved in art, but presents the portrait as a mirror, timelessly preserving the artist’s reflection after he, too, has perished. Rossetti’s poem was one of many nineteenth-century narratives penned by male writers of Aestheticism and Decadence that utilized the preservation of a beautiful woman in portrait form to assuage the male artist’s fear of death. It is this paradox, of existing in art, as an image of both male fears and fantasies, beyond life itself, that this article seeks to explore. Through the examination of two haunted-portrait narratives penned by female writers, Vernon Lee’s “Amour Dure” (1890) and E. Nesbit’s “The Ebony Frame” (1893), the concept of the haunted portrait will be analysed as a seductive force, encapsulating a beautiful young woman residing at the seemingly paradoxical intersection of sexuality and death. In both texts spectral femmes fatales haunt and seduce nineteenth-century male writers for their own, perhaps malign, purposes, allowing for an examination as to how Lee and Nesbit “re-frame” male-authored representations of portraiture. In doing so, it will be discussed how Lee and Nesbit subtly utilize the ghost story to corrupt the prevailing, masculine aesthetic principles of Aestheticism and Decadence, recording the amoral beauty of the femme fatale, and recording the visual subordination of spectator to objet d’art.",

A variety of wood types were used in these studies to provide broad information on the correlation between the cutting tools used and resulting surface morphology. The cutting tools were prepared on a computer numerical control (CNC) lathe and roughness average (Ra) and average maximum peak to valley height of the profile (Rz) parameters were measured by contact stylus. The tip radius of the TC inserts used was determined to be the most significant factor that impacted Ra and Rz. In summary, we found that the tip radius of the TC insert was inversely proportional to the roughness level, indicating that a flatter TC insert cutting end results in a smoother wood surface.",

        "abstract": "As in most organisms, the surface of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is associated with bacteria. To examine whether this association depends on cuticle quality, we isolated and quantified surface bacteria in normal and melanized flies applying a new and simple protocol. On wild flies maintained in the laboratory, we identified two persistently culturable species as Lactobacillus plantarum and Acetobacter pomorum by 16S rDNA sequencing. For quantification, we showered single flies for DNA extraction avoiding the rectum to prevent contamination from the gut. In quantitative PCR analyses, we determined the relative abundance of these two species in surface wash samples. On average, we found 17-times more A. pomorum than L. plantarum. To tentatively study the importance of the cuticle for the interaction of the surface with these bacteria, applying Crispr/Cas9 gene editing in the initial wild flies, we generated flies mutant for the ebony gene needed for cuticle melanisation and determined the L. plantarum to A. pomorum ratio on these flies. We found that the ratio between the two bacterial species reversed on ebony flies. We hypothesize that the cuticle chemistry is crucial for surface bacteria composition. This finding may inspire future studies on cuticle-microbiome interactions.",

        "abstract": "Body pigmentation is an important character of insects in adapting to biotic and abiotic environmental challenges. Additionally, based on the relative ease of screening, several genes involved in insect melanization have been used in classic genetic studies or as visual markers in constructing transgenic insects. Here, a homologue of the Bombyx mori melanization‐inhibiting gene ebony, associated with the conversion of dopamine to N‐β‐alanyl dopamine, was identified in a global pest, Plutella xylostella. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was applied to generate multiple Pxebony knockout alleles which were crossed to produce a Pxebony knockout strain, showing darker pigmentation in larvae, pupae and adults, compared with wildtype. Interestingly, we observed that Pxebony heterozygotes displayed an intermediate darkened phenotype, indicating partial dominance between the knockout and wildtype alleles. The fitness costs of Pxebony deficiency were also assessed in the mutant strain, indicating that embryo hatchability and larval survival were significantly reduced, while the eclosion rate was not obviously affected. Our work provides a potential target for exploring CRISPR‐based genetics‐control systems in this economically important pest lepidopteran.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Environmental adaptation and species divergence often involve suites of co‐evolving traits. Pigmentation in insects presents a variable, adaptive, and well‐characterized class of phenotypes for which correlations with multiple other traits have been demonstrated. In Drosophila, the pigmentation genes ebony and tan have pleiotropic effects on flies' response to light, creating the potential for correlated evolution of pigmentation and vision. Here, we investigate differences in light preference within and between two sister species, Drosophila americana and D. novamexicana, which differ in pigmentation in part because of evolution at ebony and tan and occupy environments that differ in many variables including solar radiation. We hypothesized that lighter pigmentation would be correlated with a greater preference for environmental light and tested this hypothesis using a habitat choice experiment. In a first set of experiments, using males of D. novamexicana line N14 and D. americana line A00, the light‐bodied D. novamexicana was found slightly but significantly more often than D. americana in the light habitat. A second experiment, which included additional lines and females as well as males, failed to find any significant difference between D. novamexicana‐N14 and D. americana‐A00. Additionally, the other dark line of D. americana (A04) was found in the light habitat more often than the light‐bodied D. novamexicana‐N14, in contrast to our predictions. However, the lightest line of D. americana, A01, was found substantially and significantly more often in the light habitat than the two darker lines of D. americana, thus providing partial support for our hypothesis. Finally, across all four lines, females were found more often in the light habitat than their more darkly pigmented male counterparts. Additional replication is needed to corroborate these findings and evaluate conflicting results, with the consistent effect of sex within and between species providing an especially intriguing avenue for further research.",

        "abstract": "This research examines the representations of African-American stereotype and the struggle of Black American girl in National Spelling Bee contest in Hollywood movie entitled Akeelah and the Bee (2006). The use of African-American English (AAVE) is one of the stereotype often depicted in Hollywood movie. Race theories are used to examine the relationship between race, racism and power. Meanwhile, Roland Barthes’s theory and semiotic film theory are used to examine the meaning portrayed in the movie. Findings show that the representation of Akeelah as a successful participant in the spelling bee competition challenges the stereotype of African American as academic underclass, and as associated with crime, failure and frustration. Akeelah is represented as a successful African American girl as she assimilates (adopts) American values of change/mobility, time and its importance, action and work orientation. The assimilation is achieved through a mentoring process and support from African American community. Keywords: African-American, African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Stereotype, Spelling Bee",

        "abstract": "In this study, the preparation of activated carbons from various materials of biomass origin by activation with potassium hydroxide and a comprehensive computer analysis of their porous structure and adsorption properties based on benzene (C6H6) adsorption isotherms were carried out. In particular, the influence of the mass ratio of the activator’s dry mass to the char mass on the formation of the microporous structure of the obtained activated carbons was analysed. The summary of the analyses carried out based on benzene adsorption isotherms begged the conclusion that activated carbon with a maximum adsorption volume in the first adsorbed layer and homogeneous surface can be obtained from ebony wood at a mass ratio of the activator to the char of R = 3. The obtained results confirmed the superiority of the new numerical-clustering-based adsorption analysis (LBET) method over simple methods of porous structure analysis, such as the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Dubinin–Raduskevich (DR) methods. The LBET method is particularly useful in the evaluation of the influence of the methods and conditions of production of activated carbons on the formation of their porous structure. This method, together with an appropriate economic analysis, can help in the precise selection of methods and conditions for the process of obtaining activated carbons at specific manufacturing costs, and thus makes it possible to obtain materials that can successfully compete with those of other technologies used in industrial practice and everyday life.",

        "abstract": "This paper argues for Ebony’s effective intervention during the Black revolts that swept the U.S between 1966 and 1967. While Ebony was a glossy magazine designed for promoting Black fashion, advertising, and consumerism, it also proved to be a critical outlet aiming at bringing about a social reformation to Black America. At the time when the popular and the regional White and Black-owned media did not provide a practical resolution to the race riots whilst others generated instances of sensationalism to vilify the Black revolt, Ebony appeared as a sui generis magazine by providing viable social resolutions to quell the Black revolts and the social problems impinging upon Black Americans. This intervention was culminated in a special issue which critically addressed the Black youth and their rationale behind sparking off the revolts. Its intervention, however, paid off, with the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders approaching the magazine to procure copies to use them on its investigation of the riots while inviting its senior editor Lerone Bennett Jr. to participate in its close meetings on the civil disorder. Based on archival materials as well as Ebony’s special issues, this article sheds new light on Ebony’s social standing in Post-war America.",

Biodiversitas 22: 2738-2753. Diospyros L. (Ebenaceae) is an economically important genus that covers over 500 plant species. Members of this group are known to produce hard, dark, high-quality timbers known as ebony trees, while other members are known as persimmon trees. There is limited information on the morphological characters and phenetic relationship of this genus from Indonesian archipelago. In this work, we reported the phenetic clustering of 14 species of Indonesian Diospyros, based on plant habit, stem, leaves, and fruit characters, which was analysed using UPGMA and Jaccard similarity index. The phenetic dendrogram divided the 14 species of Diospyros into two main clusters which separating Subgen. Maba and Eudiospyros. Further, subgen. Maba was clustered into a single cluster while subgen. Eudiospyros was divided into 3 sub-clusters as sister groups. The clustering in Eudiospyros was supported by low SI and bootstrap value, demonstrating the high morphological variation of the subgenus. The sectional separation of Diospyros spp. was considered as paraphyletic. In general, our phenetic clustering exhibited suitability and relevancy with previous classification. Fruit size and trichomes are very important in this phenetic clustering, especially to form Eudiospyros subgenus. Fruit trichomes were also special characters related to biogeographical distribution following the Wallace line theory.",

        "title": "Revisiting the Role of Social Dimensions in Metaphorical Conceptualization: Implications for Comparative Literature and Translation",
        "abstract": "Cross-cultural and within-culture variation in conceptual metaphors is a much-debated subject in Cognitive Linguistics research. The theory points out that such variation occurs on a series of dimensions, like social, ethnic, regional, stylistic and subcultural dimensions. The social dimensions consist of the separation of society into people, youthful and old, and working class and average workers. The purpose of this study was to undertake a deeper look at the distinctions caused in metaphorical conceptualization due to the attitude each individual or group of individuals possesses, especially with regard to the economic status of each group. To this end, twenty individuals were selected, with the only variable existing amongst them being their financial status. Each person was asked to write three paragraphs on three separate topics, adding up to sixty paragraphs, in an attempt to try and determine differences in metaphorical conceptualization. The results reveal interesting insights largely supporting the thinking in the theory on individual and cross-cultural variation in Conceptual Metaphors rooted in social agents’ financial statuses. Other research like the current one would contribute to our Cognitive Linguistics understanding of the social dimensions of Conceptual Metaphor variation and universality. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE According to established Cognitive Linguistics literature, metaphors are engrained into linguistic meaning-making language and are an inseparable part of most acts of linguistic communication. Even laymen with no theoretical knowledge of metaphors can still utilize and identify Conceptual Metaphors (henceforth CMs) with ease and accuracy. A large number of CMs revolving around human bodily functions and neurological aspects are universal across many languages (Kövecses, 2005). The neurological parts of the brain corresponding to the concept “up”, also correspond to the concept “more”, making grounds for the UP IS MORE metaphor (Lakoff, 2008). Likewise, the ANGER IS HEAT metaphor exists in many languages due to its being rooted in human physiology, FEAR IS LOSS OF COULOUR being of a similar nature. Other examples evidencing the universality of metaphors are more common in daily life; however, variation in metaphorical conceptualization should also be taken into account, whether it be within-culture or cross-cultural. Metaphor variation can come in many shapes and forms. Kövecses (2005) sheds light on this by arguing how a sole focus on ethnic dimensions may point to diverse ethnic classes building their metaphorical conceptualizations of a certain target domain on different source domains that are, nonetheless, congruent. One illustration of this, he contends, is Published by Australian International Academic Centre PTY.LTD. Copyright (c) the author(s). This is an open access article under CC BY license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) http://dx.doi.org/10.7575/aiac.ijclts.v.9n.1p.18 the Black American English usage of ‘nitty-gritty’ (meaning ‘important’) versus the standard white use of ‘bottom-line’ for IMPORTANCE as target domain. In both, we have the metaphor IMPORTANT IS CENTRAL at work; however, these vary in clear ways from the specific-level source domains. The ethnic factor may likewise assume a significant part in making “talking styles” that are exceptionally metaphorical. One such talking style is “playing the handfuls” in Black English Vernacular (Kochman, 1981). Essentially, embracing a regional point of view, we can note dialects like Dutch and those like Afrikaans that are derived from it, spoken in certain regions of South Africa. Dirven (1994) investigates this circumstance, analysing newspapers circulated in Afrikaans and exploring the regular metaphors in them in an attempt to see what degree of overlap there is between these metaphors and those manifested in equivalent Dutch texts. His investigation is a systematic comparison of normally and conventionally used Dutch and new Afrikaans metaphors. In the depiction of “nature” metaphors, he calls attention to the common metaphors incorporating pictures of water, light, shadow, lightning, tremor, sand, stars, wind, and mists and to the fact that this represent the normal naturally received and cognitive setting of the Low Countries (Dirven, 1994) or other northern European countries. A strange element of Dutch nature metaphors is that they never rely on animals. Contrary to this moderately International Journal of Comparative Literature & Translation Studies",

        "abstract": "\n Background: Climate plays an important role in the growth process of various plant species, and the ebony species is no exception to this. Ebony (Diospyros celebica Bakh.) is a Sulawesi endemic flora species whose wood is widely used as a material for light to heavy construction and important raw material for Indonesia’s timber industry. Massive forest exploitation threatens preservation of the Diospyros celebica, so conservation is needed to save it from extinction. However, the difficulty in distinguishing Diospyros celebica in the tillering phase caused many seed collection errors, so a system was needed to identify plants correctly. This study aims to extract leaf morphological features, analyze the correlation between leaf morphological features and climate variables, and classify them based on the region where Diospyros celebica grows. Result: The results show that several leaf morphological characteristics were sufficiently correlated with climate variables such as MAT and MAP. In dry weather, the leaves of Diospyros celebica tend to have relatively small leaf sizes, whereas, in wetter weather, the leaves tend to have a much larger size. The classification results could distinguish leaf morphology based on growing regions with an accuracy rate of 94.59%. Conclusions: By obtaining a high level of classification accuracy, it can be interpreted that the size of the leaf morphology of the same species (Diospyros celebica) is different in each region, influenced by climate variables, in this case MAT and MAP.",

        "abstract": "Wilburn Taylor and his wife wanted to go on vacation. In the summer of 1955, they looked ahead to the impending winter weather and longed for the blue skies and warm welcome that were promised in the travel brochures that drew by then over 1.5 million Americans annually to the Caribbean. Economic prosperity, advances in transportation, and an emphasis on consumption as a marker of middle class identity had precipitated a golden age of leisure and vacationing for Americans after World War II. The Taylors saved their money, asked for time off from work, and after doing some research, settled on a perspective itinerary with stops across the West Indies. The promise of sun and sand excited them, but important uncertainties remained. In a terse but revealing inquiry sent to the Pittsburgh Courier, a leading Black newspaper with a national weekly circulation of 300,000 copies, Taylor stated that he and his wife “are colored people and... would like to find out about the color question and hotel accommodations in these countries ...”. He was so desperate for advice that he was willing to pay for it. The Taylors were not alone. Letters from would-be vacationers with concerns about discriminatory practices flooded the pages of the Courier. Given the longstanding Jim Crow laws and corrosive racial etiquette in the United States, African Americans could never assume the right to access or enjoy many public accommodations at home. But knowledge and support gained through formal and informal networks allowed them to at least prepare for what they might encounter when moving within their own nation’s borders. When it came to travel outside of the United States, by contrast, uncertainties abounded. Too few had gone, and different cultural norms and languages made the terrain even more difficult to decipher. Yet with the unknown came the elusive possibility that by traveling abroad one could, albeit temporarily, escape the burden of American anti-blackness. For African Americans, the international color line was a tightrope, where they had to balance the unknown perils of international leisure travel with the potential pleasures of a vacation free from racial discrimination. Black print media served as a key resource for vacation seekers hoping to navigate the precarities of the international color line. Not only did travelers solicit advice, but an eclectic and unexpected group of travel boosters and entrepreneurs wrote articles, manned travel columns, and created guides to discuss and debate the complexities of being a postwar Black consumer, cosmopolitan, and vacationer. Most of the major Black periodicals in the postwar period, from the Courier to the Chicago Defender to the Baltimore Afro-American, carried an annual vacation section and a weekly travel advice column. Popular magazines like Ebony featured glossy",

        "abstract": "Objectives As in most organisms, the surface of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is associated with bacteria. To examine whether this association depends on cuticle quality, we isolated and quantified surface bacteria in normal and melanized flies applying a new and simple protocol. Results On wild flies maintained in the laboratory, we identified two persistently culturable species as Lactobacillus plantarum and Acetobacter pomorum by 16S rDNA sequencing. For quantification, we showered single flies for DNA extraction avoiding the rectum to prevent contamination from the gut. In quantitative PCR analyses, we determined the relative abundance of these two species in surface wash samples. On average, we found 17-times more A. pomorum than L. plantarum . To tentatively study the importance of the cuticle for the interaction of the surface with these bacteria, applying Crispr/Cas9 gene editing in the initial wild flies, we generated flies mutant for the ebony gene needed for cuticle melanisation and determined the L. plantarum to A. pomorum ratio on these flies. We found that the ratio between the two bacterial species reversed on ebony flies. We hypothesize that the cuticle chemistry is crucial for surface bacteria composition. This finding may inspire future studies on cuticle-microbiome interactions.",

        "abstract": "Commercial camera traps (CTs) commonly used in wildlife studies have several technical limitations that restrict their scope of application. They are not easily customizable, unit prices sharply increase with image quality and importantly, they are not designed to record the activity of ectotherms such as insects. Those developed for the study of plant–insect interactions are yet to be widely adopted as they rely on expensive and heavy equipment. We developed PICT (plant–insect interactions camera trap), an inexpensive (<100 USD) do‐it‐yourself CT system based on a Raspberry Pi Zero computer designed to continuously film animal activity. The system is particularly well suited for the study of pollination, insect behaviour and predator–prey interactions. The focus distance can be manually adjusted to under 5 cm. In low light conditions, a near‐infrared light automatically illuminates the subject. Frame rate, resolution and video compression levels can be set by the user. The system can be remotely controlled using either a smartphone, tablet or laptop via the onboard Wi‐Fi. PICT can record up to 72‐hr day and night videos at >720p resolution with a 110‐Wh power bank (30,000 mAh). Its ultra‐portable (<1 kg) waterproof design and modular architecture is practical in diverse field settings. We provide an illustrated technical guide detailing the steps involved in building and operating a PICT and for video post‐processing. We successfully field‐tested PICT in a Central African rainforest in two contrasting research settings: an insect pollinator survey in the canopy of the African ebony Diospyros crassiflora and the observation of rare pollination events of an epiphytic orchid Cyrtorchis letouzeyi. PICT overcomes many of the limitations commonly associated with CT systems designed to monitor ectotherms. Increased portability and image quality at lower costs allow for large‐scale deployment and the acquisition of novel insights into the reproductive biology of plants and their interactions with difficult to observe animals.",

        "title": "‘I’m Not Afraid of the Dark’",
        "abstract": "Introduction\nDarkness is often characterised as something that warrants heightened caution and scrutiny – signifying increased danger and risk. Within settler-colonial settings such as Australia, cautionary and negative connotations of darkness are projected upon Black people and their bodies, forming part of continuing colonial regimes of power (Moreton-Robinson). Negative stereotypes of “dark” continues to racialise all Indigenous peoples. In Australia, Indigenous peoples are both Indigenous and Black regardless of skin colour, and this plays out in a range of ways, some of which will be highlighted within this article. This article demonstrates that for Indigenous peoples, associations of fear and danger are built into the structural mechanisms that shape and maintain colonial understandings of Indigenous peoples and their bodies. It is this embodied form of darkness, and its negative connotations, and responses that we explore further.\n\nFigure 1: Megan Cope’s ‘I’m not afraid of the Dark’ t-shirt (Fredericks and Heemsbergen 2021)\nResponding to the anxieties and fears of settlers that often surround Indigenous peoples, Quandamooka artist and member of the art collective ProppaNow, Megan Cope, has produced a range of t-shirts, one of which declares “I’m not afraid of the Dark” (fig. 1). The wording ‘reflects White Australia’s fear of blackness’ (Dark + Dangerous). Exploring race relations through the theme of “darkness”, we begin by discussing how negative connotations of darkness are represented through everyday lexicons and how efforts to shift prejudicial and racist language are often met with defensiveness and resistance. We then consider how fears towards the dark translate into everyday practices, reinforced by media representations. The article considers how stereotype, conjecture, and prejudice is inflicted upon Indigenous people and reflects white settler fears and anxieties, rooting colonialism in everyday language, action, and norms. \nThe Language of Fear\nIndigenous people and others with dark skin tones are often presented as having a proclivity towards threatening, aggressive, deceitful, and negative behaviours. This works to inform how Indigenous peoples are “known” and responded to by hegemonic (predominantly white) populations. Negative connotations of Indigenous people are a means of reinforcing and legitimising the falsity that European knowledge systems, norms, and social structures are superior whilst denying the contextual colonial circumstances that have led to white dominance. In Australia, such denial corresponds to the refusal to engage with the unceded sovereignty of Aboriginal peoples or acknowledge Indigenous resistance.\nLanguage is integral to the ways in which dominant populations come to “know” and present the so-called “Other”. Such language is reflected in digital media, which both produce and maintain white anxieties towards race and ethnicity. When part of mainstream vernacular, racialised language – and the value judgments associated with it – often remains in what Moreton-Robinson describes as “invisible regimes of power” (75). Everyday social structures, actions, and habits of thought veil oppressive and discriminatory attitudes that exist under the guise of “normality”. Colonisation and the dominance of Eurocentric ways of knowing, being, and doing has fixated itself on creating a normality that associates Indigeneity and darkness with negative and threatening connotations. In doing so, it reinforces power balances that presents an image of white superiority built on the invalidation of Indigeneity and Blackness.\nWhite fears and anxieties towards race made explicit through social and digital media are also manifest via subtle but equally pervasive everyday action (Carlson and Frazer; Matamoros-Fernández). Confronting and negotiating such fears becomes a daily reality for many Indigenous people. During the height of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, which extended to Australia and were linked to deaths in custody and police violence, African American poet Saul Williams reminded his followers of the power of language in constructing racialised fears (saulwilliams). In an Instagram post, Williams draws back the veil of an uncontested normality to ask that we take personal responsibility over the words we use. He writes:\n\nhere’s a tip: Take the words DARK or BLACK in connection to bad, evil, ominous or scary events out of your vocabulary. We learn the stock market crashed on Black Monday, we read headlines that purport “Dark Days Ahead”. There’s “dark” or “black” humour which implies an undertone of evil, and then there are people like me who grow up with dark skin having to make sense of the English/American lexicon and its history of “fair complexions” – where “fair” can mean “light; blond.” OR “in accordance with rules or standards; legitimate.” We may not be fully responsible for the duplicitous evolution of language and subtle morphing of inherited beliefs into description yet we are in full command of the words we choose even as they reveal the questions we’ve left unasked.\n\nLike the work of Moreton-Robinson and other scholars, Williams implores his followers to take a reflexive position to consider the questions often left unasked. In doing so, he calls for the transcendence of anonymity and engagement with the realities of colonisation – no matter how ugly, confronting, and complicit one may be in its continuation. \nIn the Australian context this means confronting how terms such as “dark”, “darkie”, or “darky” were historically used as derogatory and offensive slurs for Aboriginal peoples. Such language continues to be used today and can be found in the comment sections of social media, online news platforms, and other online forums (Carlson “Love and Hate”). Taking the move to execute personal accountability can be difficult. It can destabilise and reframe the ways in which we understand and interact with the world (Rose 22). For some, however, exposing racism and seemingly mundane aspects of society is taken as a personal attack which is often met with reactionary responses where one remains closed to new insights (Whittaker). This feeds into fears and anxieties pertaining to the perceived loss of power.\nThese fears and anxieties continue to surface through conversations and calls for action on issues such as changing the date of Australia Day, the racialised reporting of news (McQuire), removing of plaques and statues known to be racist, and requests to change placenames and the names of products. For example, in 2020, Australian cheese producer Saputo Dairy Australia changed the name of it is popular brand “Coon” to “Cheer Tasty”. The decision followed a lengthy campaign led by Dr Stephen Hagan who called for the rebranding based on the Coon brand having racist connotations (ABC). The term has its racist origins in the United States and has long been used as a slur against people with dark skin, liking them to racoons and their tendency to steal and deceive. The term “Coon” is used in Australia by settlers as a racist term for referring to Aboriginal peoples. Claims that the name change is example of political correctness gone astray fail to acknowledge and empathise with the lived experience of being treated as if one is dirty, lazy, deceitful, or untrustworthy. Other brand names have also historically utilised racist wording along with imagery in their advertising (Conor). Pear’s soap for example is well-known for its historical use of racist words and imagery to legitimise white rule over Indigenous colonies, including in Australia (Jackson).\nLike most racial epithets, the power of language lies in how the words reflect and translate into actions that dehumanise others. The words we use matter. The everyday “ordinary” world, including online, is deeply politicised (Carlson and Frazer “They Got Filters”) and comes to reflect attitudes and power imbalances that encourage white people to internalise the falsity that they are superior and should have control over Black people (Conor). Decisions to make social change, such as that made by Saputo Dairy Australia, can manifest into further white anxieties via their ability to force the confrontation of the circumstances that continue to contribute to one’s own prosperity. In other words, to unveil the realities of colonialism and ask the questions that are too often left in the dark.\nLived Experiences of Darkness\nColonial anxieties and fears are driven by the fact that Black populations in many areas of the world are often characterised as criminals, perpetrators, threats, or nuisances, but are rarely seen as victims. In Australia, the repeated lack of police response and receptivity to concerns of Indigenous peoples expressed during the Black Lives Matter campaign saw tens of thousands of people take to the streets to protest. Protestors at the same time called for the end of police brutality towards Indigenous peoples and for an end to Indigenous deaths in custody. The protests were backed by a heavy online presence that sought to mobilise people in hope of lifting the veil that shrouds issues relating to systemic racism. There have been over 450 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to die in custody since the end of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991 (The Guardian). The tragedy of the Indigenous experience gains little attention internationally.\nThe negative implications of being the object of white fear and anxiety are felt by Indigenous and other Black communities daily. The “safety signals” (Daniella Emanuel) adopted by white peoples in response to often irrational perceptions of threat signify how Indigenous and other Black peoples and communities are seen and valued by the hegemony. Memes played out in social media depicting “Karens” – a term that corresponds to caricaturised white women (but equally applicable to men) who exhibit behaviours of ent",

The Higher Heating Values (HHVs) of the samples were estimated as functions of fixed carbon (FC) and volatile matter (VM), and were also calculated from an elemental composition-based correlation equation. Results showed the ranges of VM and FC were 74.95 – 75.74% and 14.25 – 14.80%, respectively. The High Heating Values (HHV) of Iroko, West African Entada, Ebony, African cam and Rough chaff, according to ultimate analysis-based correlation equation, were found to be 18.85, 18.77, 18.75, 18.55 and 18.52 MJ kg-1, respectively while according to proximate analysis-based correlation equation, were 18.41, 18.53, 18.43, 18.50 and 18.14 MJ kg-1. The high percentage of VM and the value range of FC resulted in appreciable HHVs for the samples. It can be concluded that woody biomass residues are good sources of bio-fuels for sustainable development.",

Pigmentation patterns in Drosophila are formed by the deposition of different pigments synthesized in the developing epidermis and the role of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of melanin biosynthesis pathway-related genes is well-characterized. These CREs typically exhibit modular arrangement in the regulatory region of the gene with each enhancer regulating a specific spatiotemporal expression of the gene. However, recent studies have suggested that multiple enhancers of a number of developmental genes as well as those of yellow (involved in dark pigment synthesis) exhibit redundant activities. Here we report the redundant enhancer activities in the cis-regulatory region of another gene in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, ebony, in the developing epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. The evidence was obtained by introducing an approximately 1 kbp deletion at the endogenous primary epidermis enhancer (priEE) by genome editing. The effect of the priEE deletion on pigmentation and on the endogenous expression pattern of a mCherry-tagged ebony allele was examined in the thoracic and abdominal segments. The expression level of ebony in the priEE-deleted strains was similar to that of the control strain, indicating the presence of redundant enhancer activities that drive the broad expression of ebony in the developing epidermis. Additionally, the priEE fragment contained a silencer that suppresses ebony expression in the dorsal midline of the abdominal tergites, which is necessary for the development of the subgenus Sophophora-specific dark pigmentation patterns along the midline. The endogenous expression pattern of ebony in the priEE-deleted strains and the reporter assay examining the autonomous activity of the priEE fragment indicated that the silencer is involved in repressing the activities of both proximal and distant enhancers. These results suggest that multiple silencers are dispensable in the regulatory system of a relatively stable taxonomic character. The prevalence of other redundant enhancers and silencers in the genome can be investigated using a similar approach. Author summary Genes are expressed at the right timing and place to give rise to diverse phenotypes. The spatiotemporal regulation is usually achieved through the coordinated activities of transcription-activating and transcription-repressing proteins that bind to the DNA sequences called enhancers and silencers, respectively, located near the target gene. Most studies identified the locations of enhancers by examining the ability of the sequence fragments to regulate the expression of fused reporters. Various short enhancers have been identified using this approach. This study employed an alternative approach in which the previously identified enhancer that regulates expression of ebony (a gene involved in body color formation) was deleted in a fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, using the genome-editing technique. The knockout of this enhancer did not affect the transcription level of the gene to a large extent. This indicated the presence of transcription-activating elements with redundant functions outside the deleted enhancer. Additionally, the transcription of ebony at the midline of the abdomen, which is repressed in the normal flies, were derepressed in the enhancer-deleted flies, which indicated that the deleted enhancer fragment contained a silencer that negatively regulates multiple enhancer activities in a spatially restricted manner.",

        "abstract": "Published in Paris in 1928 under the leadership of Guadeloupean Maurice Satineau, the newspaper La dépêche africaine featured a mélange of African diasporic contributors from across the French colonies. Chief among them were the Afro-Martinican intellectuals and sisters Jane and Paulette Nardal. It was here that Jane Nardal published her now famous essay “Internationalisme noir,” introducing the idea of “black internationalism” into popular parlance. Nardal documented a new understanding of blackness and collectivity amid post-World War I globalization. Just as wartime had broken down barriers among Europeans and white Americans, so too had it fostered the “sentiment” among black people from the around the world that they “belong[ed] to one and the same race.” Introducing and reifying terms such as “Afro Latino” and “African American” into French and English vernaculars, Nardal focused on black people's efforts to rhetorically and ideologically link the African diaspora while also reconciling these new identities with the “ancient traditions” of Africa. The result: one of the first efforts to define black internationalism as an ideology, worldview, and political practice in a moment in which black people the world over were trying to negotiate the modernizing world and their place in it.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly, new species are being described without there being a name-bearing type specimen. In 2015, a new species of primate was described, the golden-crowned langur Presbytis johnaspinalli Nardelli, 2015 on the basis of five photographs that were posted on the Internet in 2009. After publication, the validity of the species was questioned as it was suggested that the animals were partially and selectively bleached ebony langurs Trachypithecus auratus (É. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1812). Since the whereabouts of the animals were unknown, it was difficult to see how this matter could be resolved and the current taxonomic status of P. johnaspinalli remains unclear. I present new information about the fate of the individual animals in the photographs and their species identification. In 2009, thirteen of the langurs on which Nardelli based his description were brought to a rescue centre where, after about three months, they regained their normal black colouration confirming the bleaching hypothesis. Eight of the langurs were released in a forest and two were monitored for two months in 2014. The description of their behaviour, photographs and analysis of their cytochrome b genes confirms them as ebony langurs. There is no evidence to support the notion that the golden-crowned langur represents intermediates between melanistic and erythristic ebony langurs, nor that it represents a new species. As such, Presbytis johnaspinalli Nardelli, 2015 is a junior synonym of Trachyptihecus auratus (É. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1812). This case underscores the importance of assembling a sufficiently varied amount of data prior to describing new species and studying the actual type specimens.",

The study was conducted from 2014 to 2017 at three locations in north-central Texas with three soil types, an acidic fine sandy loam, a neutral pH silt loam, and an alkaline heavy clay. Although soils and environmental conditions caused variations between sites, overall performance among cultivars was consistent across all study sites, with Centennial Spirit having better landscape performance than any of the Ebony cultivars tested. ‘Ebony and Ivory’ and ‘Ebony Blush’ had the overall lowest landscape performance. Ebony cultivars grew more slowly, had fewer blooms, and were more susceptible to powdery mildew than Centennial Spirit.

The main locations on Suakin Island Town investigated 2002-2013 are briefly described. Interviews show that at Suakin, in the later 19th century/early 20th century, imported valuables included fabrics from Europe, perfume oils, cloths and wooden chests from India; porcelain from China and Turkey; rugs from Persia/Iran and glass from Italy. Interviews and early modern European accounts indicate the range of products from the hinterland, such as cotton, gold, ivory, ostrich feathers, slaves, horses, gum arabic, ebony, musk, tobacco, rubber and coffee. Local fishermen supplied fish, shells, pearls and mother-of-pearl. The archaeological evidence indicates pottery and porcelain from the Arabian Peninsula, south-west Asia, south Asia, China and south-east Asia, while identifications of wood samples indicates teak from south and south-east Asia. A combination of archaeological, historical and ethnographic evidence is needed to build up a picture of the trade in valuables.",

        "abstract": "The effect of methanolic extract of African Ebony (Diospyros mespiliformis) on glucose level,   liver and kidney function biomarkers in alloxan induced diabetic rat was investigated. The rats were grouped into four of ten (10) rats each. The rats in Group B, C and D were induced with 0.4mL of alloxan. Group C was treated with 0.3 mL of methanol stem back of Diospyros mespiliformis, Group D was treated with 1.3 mL of metformin; Group A non-diabetic and Group B diabetic untreated. There was a significance increase (P<0.05) in serum glucose level (23.95±1.04mmol/L) of diabetic untreated rat when compared with the normal rat (5.59±0.22mmol/L) Group A. There was also a significant difference P<0.05 in glucose level of the Groups treated with extract (15.90±0.29mmol/L)  and Group treated with metformin (17.25±0.28mmol/L)  when compared with diabetic untreated rat (23.95±1.04mmol/L). The effect of extract on Liver marker enzymes AST shows a significant (P<0.05) decrease in the Group treated with extract (11.00±0.40U/L) and metformin (11.04±1.08U/L) when compared with untreated (12.88±0.53g/L). ALT showed significant (P<0.05) decrease in the Groups treated with extract (11.05±1.07U/L) and metformin (11.02±1.11U/L) when compared with untreated Group (14.58±0.76g/L). There was a significance P<0.05 increase of Total protein in untreated rats (66.00±2.26g/L) when compared with extract (11.25±1.15g/L) and treated with metformin (11.75±1.11g/L). There was a significance P<0.05 decrease in ALB in diabetic untreated (41.25±0.25g/L) when compared with that treated with extract (57.25±4.37g/L) and metformin (60.20±1.88g/L) and untreated rats. The values of renal function, Urea (6.74±1.76) mMol/l for Group A, (6.50±1.56) mMol/l for Group B, (8.87±1.10)mMol/l for Group C and (8.44±1.21) mMol/l for Group D. Creatinine values (0.44±0.01) mMol/l for Group A, (4.02±0.36) mMol/l for Group B, (3.16±0.10) mMol/l for Group C and (0.46±0.10) mMol/l.

        "abstract": "This paper studies how two recent neo-slave narratives have been translated into Spanish: The Good Lord Bird, by James McBride, and The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. Since they were both published simultaneously in Spain in September 2017, special attention is paid to the strategies used to render Black English, which marks slaves’ otherness, in the target polysystem. An overview of the origin, rise, and evolution of neo-slave narratives precedes the features of African-American Vernacular English portrayed in the novels that belong to this sub-genre. After some insights into the issue of translating literary dialect, the risks it entails, and the different strategies that can be used, the Spanish versions of McBride’s and Whitehead’s works are analyzed accordingly and contrasted.",

        "abstract": "Ebony (Diospyros celebica Bakh.) is an endemic plant on Celebes (Sulawesi) island. Extractive compounds within ebony wood cause it to have durability, strength, and beautiful patterns. In this study, we used near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to discriminate between ebony wood samples, based on their origins at different growth sites on Celebes island, and to develop quantitative models to predict the extractive content of ebony wood. A total of 45 wood meal samples from 11 sites located in West, Central, and South Celebes were collected in this study. NIR spectral data were acquired from hot water and ethanol–benzene soluble extracts from ebony wood in this study. The extractive content of the ebony was 10.408% and 10.774% based on hot water solubility and treatment with ethanol–benzene solvent, respectively. Multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis–discriminant analysis revealed that ebony wood from West Celebes differed from most of the wood from South Celebes; however, it was only slightly different from ebony wood from Central Celebes based on NIR spectra data. These findings were in line with the extractive contents obtained. Partial least square regression models based on wood meal spectra could potentially be used to estimate the hot water and ethanol–benzene extractive contents from ebony wood.",

        "abstract": "The article deals with the issue of linguistic and cultural realia and their peculiarities in Tony Morrison’s novel «Jazz». The study is carried out in the multicultural aspect and begins with the detailed analysis of the terms ‘multiculturalism’ and ‘multicultural literature’. The theoretical background of the article is based on the works of Taylor, Sanders, Gutmann,Zverev, Tolkachev, Denisova, Tlostanova in which they defined the concept of multiculturalism and dwelled on the issues of ethnic literatures and their peculiarities. The article focuses on the specific features of the multicultural phenomenon in AfricanAmerican society, on the issues of the national identity and language identity of African-Americanpeople. The article outlines the major means of expression the national and cultural code in the artistic text, gives the definition of the term ‘realia’, emphasizes the importance of these linguistic means in conveying the authentic cultural atmosphere of the text. Characteristic features of the novel «Jazz» are analyzed in the research as well as the use of various linguo-cultural devices such as anthroponyms, toponyms, cultural and historical realia, symbols, allusions, cultural myths. The peculiarities of the language of the protagonists are also studied in detail, such as the use of African American Vernacular English. The article outlines the brightest examples of the combination of language and culture in the work of fiction in the multicultural aspect.",

        "title": "Preserving the dead",
        "abstract": "From the earliest antiquarian letters to the poetic evocations of Heaney, the words used to describe bog bodies conjure their remarkable yet unsettling power. They are ‘entire and uncorrupted’ (Leigh 1700: 65), found as ‘in a common posture of sleep’ (de la Pryme 1870: 983), ‘as fresh as if death had occurred the preceding day’ (Gear 1883, cited in Cowie et al. 2011: 8). Yet the bog has inevitably altered and stained these remains; they are described by Low as ‘rolled up in their own leather’ (cited in Anderson 1879: liii) or ‘tanned and dried in a remarkable manner’ (Lukis 1892: ix). The slightly glossy, madderbrown hue produced by the peat thus lends such remains a sense of antiquity, even permanence. Heaney (1972: 36) captures this beautifully in ‘The Tollund Man’: the fen’s ‘dark juices working / Him to a saint’s kept body’. Glyn Daniel also evoked how this corpse produced a sense of ‘humanity, serenity ... as if carved in ebony’ while his fellow presenter, Mortimer Wheeler, described him as ‘the most haunting relic of antiquity I have ever seen’ (BBC 1954). Such ‘haunting power’ arises from the eerie lifelikeness of a bog body. Even recently, Irish curator Rolly Reed revealed that he felt ‘freaked’ by the enormous reach of Old Croghan Man’s arms and his perfect fingerprints, admitting to flashbacks and nightmares (cited in Grice 2006: 19– 21). He could have been, as Reed put it, anyone from the streets of Dublin. The bog appears to have stopped decay, or at least to have stilled it. The things caught in its waters appear to stand outside of time – although we know they are dead these ancient bodies somehow defy mortality. For some, this nearliving afterlife creates a sense of immortality, of hope even, in the face of our own finitude. Yet their unique material valence, their ‘fleshiness and overt corporeality’, is unsettling – mirroring life while being clearly estranged from it (Sanders 2009: 50). For others, it creates unease, since ‘what should be dead appears to be alive’ (Wallace 2004: 57). Meeting such remains can produce ‘feelings of confusion, alarm, surprise, even trickery, prompting us to reconcile what can seem to be contradictory facts and categorical boundaries’ (Fredengren 2016: 492). Bog bodies thus epitomise Freud’s concept Preserving the dead 3",

        "abstract": "Neste estudo abordamos questões relativas ao inglês vernacular afro-americano e suas implicações sociolinguísticas. A problemática levantada aqui refere-se ao cenário encontrado em muitas salas de aulas de escolas públicas regulares daquele país, nas quais diferentes etnias com diferentes línguas são atendidas por professores que, muitas vezes, se sentem desorientados quanto à forma de abordar tal multiplicidade. Nosso foco principal é a variedade do inglês vernacular afro-americano (IVAA) ou African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Estudos desenvolvidos desde a década se 1970, sobretudo os de Labov (1972, 2008), são até hoje discutidos, pois a situação dos falantes do IVAA parece ainda causar divergências entre os acadêmicos que pesquisam o assunto. A grande questão aqui é como conciliar a variante do IVAA com o ensino de inglês padrão/culto preconizado em sala de aula. No Brasil, encontramos situação semelhante quando nos referimos ao tratamento dado aos falantes da variedade rural (BORTONI-RICARDO, 2011). Além dos aspectos sócio-histórico-culturais sobre o ensino-aprendizagem de inglês aos afrodescendentes norte-americanos, apresentamos também os aspectos sintáticos causadores de divergências entre o inglês padrão/culto e o inglês vernacular afro-americano. Documentos oficiais americanos como o “Bilingual Education Act” (1968) e órgãos como o “National Council of Teachers of English” (2008) estão em consonância com pesquisadores como Labov (2008) e Pullum (1999) que reafirmam a necessidade de conscientizar o professorado sobre as questões sociolinguísticas envolvidas e alertam para o respeito e a aceitação de variantes não-padrão em sala de aula.",

        "abstract": "A remarkable scene is attested on the western gate room of the pylon of Philae temple in Aswan. The scene represents three fecundity figures on each vertical’s columns. The three male figures personify three districts in Lower Nubia, namely Mekhat, Maâmaâ and Bakt. The function of these figures is explained according to the textual accompanied the scene. Ptolemy IV Philopator was depicted as one of the three offering bearers presenting offering to the main god of the temple. The relation between the Ptolemaic king and fecundity figure is emblematic in order to follow the divine cult of the temple. The scene records a single elephant figure on the pylon room referring to ivory. The ebony, ivory and stones products were brought from Lower Nubia to be offered to goddess Isis. This paper will analyse the connotation of this remarkable scene in accordance to its textual evidence. The researcher will approach the historical, religious background on the elephant as an offering during the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator. The analytical study will also allow to differentiate between the three fecundity figures on each vertical hieroglyphic column.",

        "abstract": "With the objective of understanding the mid-late Holocene subsistence pattern and the local ecology, archaeobotanical investigation was conducted on soil samples collected from 29 contexts from the rock shelter site of Mochena Borago. The samples were collected by the French Archaeological Mission in 2000 and 2001 field seasons. Flotation was carried out using bucket and 2.0 mm mesh size sieve. Recovered botanical remains were classified based on size and grain morphology. Seed analysis was conducted at 5-20x magnification.  A total of 112 seeds and fruit stones were identified which include 55 Sapindaceae cf. Deinbollia type (dune soap-berry), 33 Myrtaceae cf. Syzigium guineense type (sometimes called waterberry), 9 Plectranthus edulis (Wolayta dinich/potato), 7 Euphorbiaceae Croton sp. (rushfoil), 2 Cordia cf. africana (wanza in Amharic), 1 Ebenaceae cf. Diospyros (commonly known as ebony trees), 1 Olea europea ssp. africana (Olive Oil). Plectranthus edulis is an indigenous crop for the study area and Cordia cf. africana and Olea europea ssp. africana are reported for the first time in archaeological context of the whole region of Ethiopia. The study provided data on the ancient economy and ecology of the site in a region where archaeobotanical research is limited.",

To maintain the existence of Ebony, it is necessary to provide good seedling quality through the tissue culture method. Tissue culture is one of the clonal propagation techniques for mass propagation. Moreover, it is able to produce a large quantity of plants in a relatively short time and obtain superior seedling. The process of sterilizing plant material (explants) is an important activity in tissue culture which aims to eliminate microorganisms carried during explant extract, which can cause contamination. This study aimed to obtain the optimal sterilization procedure for Ebony in vitro micropropagation. The analysis used was descriptive analysis by observing the percentage of contaminated explants, types of contamination, and explants that had browned (browning). Sterilization using Bactericides and Fungicides showed the lowest contamination level (71%).

Tropical wood dust samples were made using a hand orbital sander Makita 9556CR 1400 W, and sized using the automatic mesh vibratory sieve machine Retsch AS 200 control. Most dust particles (between 50–79%) from all wood samples were under 100 μm in size. This higher percentage is associated with the risk of inhaling the dust, causing damage to the respiratory system, and the risk of a dust-air explosive mixture. Results of granulometric fractions contribution of tropical woods sanding dust were similar. Ignition temperature was changed by particle sizes, and decreased with a decrease in particle sizes. We found that marblewood has the highest minimum ignition temperature (400–420 °C), and padauk has the lowest (370–390 °C).",

        "abstract": "The author investigated the use of AAVE by Brian Imanuel or Rich Brian in his rap song lyrics. This study aimed to identify the grammatical features of AAVE in Brian's Amen album. Further, this study was also explored the underlying effect on Brian's use of AAVE. This study applied a descriptive-qualitative method. The context of the data in this study was song lyrics. The results are as follows: Brian rap song lyrics' contained 7 out of AAVE's 13 grammatical features. Those are  copula absence, invariant be, completive done, specialized auxiliaries, negation, nominal,  and  ain't . The causal effect on the use of AAVE by Brian is influenced by the environment or neighborhoods where he grew up. Growing up around his friends who use AAVE in their daily conversation leads him to obtain AAVE's native-like control. Likewise, AAVE's use was the main effect of the linguistic marketplace in order to project identities in stable ways.",

        "abstract": "The typical black coloured ebony wood (Diospyros, Ebenaceae) is desired as a commercial timber because of its durable and aesthetic properties. Surprisingly, a comprehensive wood anatomical overview of the genus is lacking, making it impossible to fully grasp the diversity in microscopic anatomy and to distinguish between CITES protected species native to Madagascar and the rest. We present the largest microscopic wood anatomical reference database for ebony woods and reconstruct evolutionary patterns in the microscopic wood anatomy within the family level using an earlier generated molecular phylogeny. Wood samples from 246Diospyrosspecies are described based on standardised light microscope observations. For the ancestral state reconstruction, we selected eight wood anatomical characters from 88 Ebenaceae species (including 29 MalagasyDiospyrosspecies) that were included in the most recently reconstructed family phylogeny. WithinDiospyros, the localisation of prismatic crystals (either in axial parenchyma or in rays) shows the highest phylogenetic value and appears to have a biogeographical signal. The molecular defined subcladeDiospyrosclade IX can be clearly distinguished from other ebony woods by its storied structure. Across Ebenaceae,Lissocarpais distinguishable from the remaining genera by the combined presence of scalariform and simple vessel perforation plates, andRoyenatypically has silica bodies instead of prismatic crystals. The local deposition of prismatic crystals and the presence of storied structure allow identifying ebony wood species at the subgeneric level, but species-level identification is not possible. In an attempt to improve the identification accuracy of the CITES protected Malagasy woods, we applied computer vision algorithms based on microscopic images from our reference database (microscopic slides from ca. 1000Diospyrosspecimens) and performed chemical profiling based on DART TOFMS.",

However, NLP models have historically been developed using dominant English varieties, such as Standard American English (SAE), due to text corpora availability. We investigate the performance of GPT-2 on AAVE text by creating a dataset of intent-equivalent parallel AAVE/SAE tweet pairs, thereby isolating syntactic structure and AAVE- or SAE-specific language for each pair. We evaluate each sample and its GPT-2 generated text with pretrained sentiment classifiers and find that while AAVE text results in more classifications of negative sentiment than SAE, the use of GPT-2 generally increases occurrences of positive sentiment for both. Additionally, we conduct human evaluation of AAVE and SAE text generated with GPT-2 to compare contextual rigor and overall quality.",

Based on these problems, a solution is sought using the Multi Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) decision support system method , and is assisted by experts in determining the right criteria related to determining the best wood used in making guitar materials, after a long time discussing the correct criteria were found based on the problem, in the form of criteria for wood strength, wood grain, texture, and wood weight. All of these criteria are then processed using the MOORA decision support system method. After processing, the best results are obtained. The right wood for guitar making is ebony with 23.6831 results occupying the first rank. Proving the results of the MOORA decision support system method, a questionnaire was carried out directly to several guitar makers with a total of 14 people, resulting in an accuracy of 85.71% which means that it has significant verification, that ebony wood is best used as a guitar-making material",

        "abstract": "The article is devoted to the technologies of the finishing works of furniture in the second half of the 19th century. During this period, the imitation of expensive wood, using cheaper woods, became a common practice. The most popular method was the imitation of walnut wood. This finishing was used both for palace furniture and pieces of furniture made by craftsmen. Numerous handbooks published instructions that were used for the imitation of expensive materials. The analysis of the instructions published, revealed their frequent repeatability. The research, which took place during restoration work, made it possible to describe some of them. Particularly noteworthy is the information about the technology of carving furniture in the forms of Second Rococo, in the finishing layer. Such decoration was used in new pieces of furniture as well as in old furniture from the period of Classicism, which were found in eclectic interiors. The furniture of the period under review, as well as architecture, for a long time had been considered to be second-class art. This opinion is not unfounded, however, a qualitative assessment of furniture from this period should be made. Many examples of eclectic furniture reflected the tastes of their time and the level of knowledge about the original historical styles. The material and technologies of imitated finishes as well as eclecticism itself, underwent changes over time. At its initial phase, there was a craze for walnut cutting, in the 1880s ebony wood, and mahogany in the beginning of the 20th century. Nevertheless, walnut cutting was associated with the manufacturing of furniture until the beginning of the 20th century. The furniture is very important to us as an example of the views and taste of this period, though not all of them can be considered to be masterpieces. During the restoration work, the finishing layer was often destroyed. As a result, it is very important to save the examples of finishes “under the walnut wood”.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an analysis of the impact of the activator to the product of carbonized materials mass ratio on the porous structure of activated carbons prepared from mahogany, ebony, and hornbeam wood by carbonization and chemical activation with potassium hydroxide. The analyses were carried out on nitrogen adsorption isotherms using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Dubinin-Radushkevitch (DR), and Quenched Solid Density Functional Theory (QSDFT) methods, as well as the numerical clustering-based adsorption analysis (LBET) method. The activated carbons with the best adsorption properties and homogeneous surfaces were prepared at a mass ratio of R = 3. The analyses suggest the significant potential of producing adsorbents characterized by a large surface area and adsorptive capacity from raw materials such as mahogany, ebony, and hornbeam wood. The analyses in question also included an evaluation of the usability and reliability of the results obtained with the employed methods of structural analysis. Particular focus was placed on the limitations of adsorption models and on critically analyzing the output data. Our study shows the unique advantages of the LBET method compared to the other methods used. The LBET method allowed us, for example, to determine the degree of heterogeneity of the surface of the studied activated carbons and the shape of the clusters of adsorbate molecules formed in the pores of the studied material, as well as obtain information about the distribution of adsorption energy on the first adsorbed layer. This study also demonstrates the limitations of the methods used and the necessity to use LBET and QSDFT methods simultaneously for porous structural analysis. The simultaneous analysis of the adsorption isotherms via the LBET and the QSDFT methods makes it possible to choose the optimal preparation conditions while considering the properties of the original raw material. The analyses also suggest the complementary character of the employed methods and the scope of the useful and reliable information that can be obtained with these methods.",

        "abstract": "Ebony (Diospyros celebica Bakh.) is an endemic tree species of Sulawesi. Based on the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, it is one of the protected tree species and listed in IUCN Red List under the category of vulnerable. This species is well known for its beautiful and luxurious wood. In practice, natural forests dominated by Diospyros can be managed using the Indonesian Selective Logging System (TPTI). The purpose of this paper was to determine the cultivation and management techniques of ebony plants in order to establish ebony plantations and their conservation strategy. Data were collected based on primary field observation and review of previous research written by other authors. Direct field observations were conducted to collect data on the management of seed, scarification techniques, germination, and seedling growth increment (height and diameter), while secondary data were collected from Diospyros-related studies. From the study, it was identified that the best time to produce fruit for the species was between September - November, with a germination rate, was up to 94.67%. The recommended parent trees should be over 20 years old. Seedlings were weaned when having 2 - 4 leaves with compost enriched with NPK as the best planting media. The seedling can be moved to the planting location after the age of 8-9 months with weeding as the initial treatment. The optimum growth for nine-year-old Ebony trees may reach 6.5 m in height and 6.63 cm in diameter and this growth may still be seen for 12 years old trees that showed 9 m in height and 12.81 cm in diameter. Based on this optimum growth, it is prospective to establish ebony plantation and or enrichment planting as long as the silvicultural aspect described in this study was used as a basic guideline.",

        "title": "My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich by I. Zoboi",
        "abstract": "Zoboi, Ibi. My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich. Penguin Random House, 2019. \nMy Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich is Ibi Zoboi’s middle-grade debut, following her YA novels Pride and the National Book Award finalist American Street. Some of Zoboi’s concerns in her YA fiction are revisited here: Black community and communities, complexities of family relationships, and the difficulties and joys of discovering new places. Here Zoboi adds to the mix a quirky, sci-fi loving protagonist, and a historical setting: Harlem in the summer of 1984. \nEbony-Grace Norfleet Freeman (aka E-Grace Starfleet in her galactic \"imagination location,\" aka Ice Cream Sandwich to the Nine Flavas crew of MCs and B-girls) is a seventh-grader from Huntsville who is sent to live with her father in New York City for the summer. She’s full of science fiction knowledge and enthusiasm, abetted by her Granddaddy, who worked for NASA and occupies a large role in her internal narrative as Captain Fleet. \nEbony-Grace is a somewhat frustrating protagonist, making a number of seeming unforced errors due to her commitment to her spacefaring alter ego, but she is authentic and compelling, too. Her insistence on being E-Grace Starfleet can be endearing, though she’s clearly using her imagination to avoid dealing with, or understanding, what’s happening around her. She describes her surroundings in terms of her space adventure: that Captain Fleet has been taken captive by the Sonic King on Planet Boom Box, and that the Sonic Boom threatens to overtake everything. Her new friends initially have little time for this kind of play; they’re busy developing their crew’s double-dutch, rapping and breakdancing skills in preparation for a competition that might get them into the big leagues. The culture-shock contrast, in other words, isn’t just between Huntsville and Harlem, but also between one kind of play and (although the Nine Flavas crew don’t see it like this) another; between childhood and adolescence. \nA caution for readers who appreciate concreteness: one subplot seems ambiguous to the point of opacity. Ebony-Grace has been sent to New York because of some trouble her Granddaddy has gotten into, or possibly a health crisis he is having. There are allusions from adult characters to sins Ebony-Grace’s grandfather has committed, consequences for bad decisions, lawyers, and journalists. His death near the end of the novel leaves both Ebony-Grace and the reader with questions but little closure; veiled references imply a sex-and-drugs aspect to his troubles, or a connection to the AIDS crisis, but this is never clarified.The narrative here is more atmospheric than propulsive, but that atmosphere is alive with culture and history. Character voices are lively, funny, and down to earth; their moment is depicted lovingly and specifically but without preciousness or nostalgia. This love letter to 1980s New York has mountains of appeal for any reader interested in science fiction or hip hop culture, and is a must for any collection looking to continue prioritizing diversity and representation in its holdings. \nHighly recommended: 4 out of 4 starsReviewer: Amanda Daignault  \nAmanda Daignault is a PhD Candidate in the Department of English and Film Studies at the University of Alberta.

        "abstract": "Some species of Diospyros form the black wood that is known as ebony. Infrequently, D. kaki forms wood with black patterning that is called “kurogaki” in Japan and is highly valued. To understand the mechanism of formation of the blackened xylem, we attempted to clarify the pathways of diffusion of colored substances from the site of their biosynthesis to their deposition in secondary xylem. We observed colored substances in pits and intercellular spaces and we recorded the deposition of colored substances in the cell walls of wood fibers. In gray and black regions, we found colored substances in the pits between xylem cells, in blind pits and in intercellular spaces. At the boundary between whitish and black regions, areas of coloration in the cell walls of wood fibers gradually increased in size from the whitish to the black regions. Heavy deposition of colored substances was observed in the inner region of the secondary walls of wood fibers. Furthermore, coloration of the outer region of the secondary walls and compound middle lamella (CML) of wood fibers gradually became stronger toward the black regions. Our observations suggest that pit-pairs and intercellular spaces might provide the pathways for inter- and extracellular diffusion of colored substances, respectively. In addition, colored substances might penetrate the cell walls of wood fibers, moving from the lumen into the cell wall.",

        "abstract": "The biological resistance of 21 tropical wood species against bacteria and molds was studied. The gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli had none or negligible activity on surfaces of zebrano and macaranduba (up to 1 ×106 CFU/mL), and they had negligible or medium activity on surfaces of macassar ebony, ovengol, santos rosewood, and iroko (from 1 ×106 up to 1 ×107 CFU/mL). These bacteria had high activity on surfaces of okoume, tineo, doussie, makore, and both reference woods, beech and Scots pine (usually over 1 ×107 CFU/mL). The mold growth activity (MGA) of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium brevicompactum was minimal on surfaces of ipe, yellow balau, macassar ebony, doussie, bubinga, and merbau, but it was strong on surfaces of okoume, cerejeira, ovengol, wenge, sapelli, and both reference woods. When comparing individual biological tests of (a) bacterial and mold but also (b) bacterial, mold and rot with decaying fungi C. puteana and T. versicolor, no significant relationships were found. These results confirm that the bio-durability of woods is influenced not only by their molecular structure, but also by the attacking biological pest group.",

        "abstract": "Phenotypic variation within a species is often structured geographically in clines. In Drosophila americana, a longitudinal cline for body color exists within North America that appears to be due to local adaptation. The tan and ebony genes have been hypothesized to contribute to this cline, with alleles of both genes that lighten body color found in D. americana. These alleles are similar in sequence and function to the allele fixed in D. americana’s more lightly pigmented sister species, Drosophila novamexicana. To test this hypothesis, we examined the frequency and geographic distribution of D. novamexicana-like alleles of tan and ebony in D. americana. Among alleles from over 100 strains of D. americana isolated from 21 geographic locations, we failed to identify additional alleles of tan or ebony with as much sequence similarity to D. novamexicana as the alleles previously described. However, using genetic analysis of 51 D. americana strains derived from 20 geographic locations, we identified one new allele of ebony and one new allele of tan segregating in D. americana that are functionally equivalent to the D. novamexicana allele. An additional 5 alleles of tan also showed marginal evidence of functional similarity. Given the rarity of these alleles, however, we conclude that they are unlikely to be driving the pigmentation cline. Indeed, phenotypic distributions of the 51 backcross populations analyzed indicate a more complex genetic architecture, with diversity in the number and effects of loci altering pigmentation observed both within and among populations of D. americana. This genetic heterogeneity poses a challenge to association studies and genomic scans for clinal variation, but might be common in natural populations.",

We perturb the inflectional morphology of words to craft plausible and semantically similar adversarial examples that expose these biases in popular NLP models, e.g., BERT and Transformer, and show that adversarially fine-tuning them for a single epoch significantly improves robustness without sacrificing performance on clean data.",

        "abstract": "The charcoal produced in Mexico comes from different species and processes, so that its characteristics have a wide variation. The objective was to characterize the charcoal produced in the North Central region of Mexico according to international standards of quality and energy. Three bags of nine commercial provenances of mesquite charcoal ( Prosopis sp.), ebony ( Ebenopsis sp.) and oak ( Quercus sp.), were randomly collected. Readings were obtained for particle size, volatile material, moisture content, fixed carbon, calorific value and the elements Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn and Fe. Data were subjected to analysis of variance under a completely randomized design with four replications per bag and comparison of means were developed with Tukey test. It was found a predominance of 20 mm > X ≤ 50 mm size, only two provenances showed fragments > 100 mm. Mean values were: moisture content 5.1%, volatile material 25.9%, ash 6.3% and fixed carbon 62.7%. The highest calorific value was 27 669 kJ kg -1 and higher values for Ca (177 267 mg kg -1 ) and Mg (20 263 mg kg -1 ). Provenances 5, 7 and 8 showed more fixed carbon and volatile material. The variation was related to plant species, provenance as well as the method of production. It is necessary to improve charcoal quality according to particle size, fixed carbon and calorific value; as well as low levels for moisture content, volatile material, and ash content. The constant evaluation of these characteristics will improve the quality of the coal produced in Mexico and facilitate its trading in the international markets.",

        "abstract": "Hate speech and offensive language are rampant on social media. Machine learning has provided a way to moderate foul language at scale. However, much of the current research focuses on overall performance. Models may perform poorly on text written in a minority dialectal language. For instance, a hate speech classifier may produce more false positives on tweets written in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). To measure these problems, we need text written in both AAVE and Standard American English (SAE). Unfortunately, it is challenging to curate data for all linguistic styles in a timely manner—especially when we are constrained to specific problems, social media platforms, or by limited resources. In this paper, we answer the question, “How can we evaluate the performance of classifiers across minority dialectal languages when they are not present within a particular dataset?” Specifically, we propose an automated fairness fuzzing tool called FuzzE to quantify the fairness of text classifiers applied to AAVE text using a dataset that only contains text written in SAE. Overall, we find that the fairness estimates returned by our technique moderately correlates with the use of real ground-truth AAVE text. Warning: Offensive language is displayed in this manuscript.",

        "abstract": "Significance Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems are now used in a variety of applications to convert spoken language to text, from virtual assistants, to closed captioning, to hands-free computing. By analyzing a large corpus of sociolinguistic interviews with white and African American speakers, we demonstrate large racial disparities in the performance of five popular commercial ASR systems. Our results point to hurdles faced by African Americans in using increasingly widespread tools driven by speech recognition technology. More generally, our work illustrates the need to audit emerging machine-learning systems to ensure they are broadly inclusive. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems, which use sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to convert spoken language to text, have become increasingly widespread, powering popular virtual assistants, facilitating automated closed captioning, and enabling digital dictation platforms for health care. Over the last several years, the quality of these systems has dramatically improved, due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern, however, that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems—developed by Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft—to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total, this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies—such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English—to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.",

        "abstract": "Diversity in fruit genetic resources in Nepal is contributed by wild, indigenous and exotic sources. This study was carried out to bring together the available fruit species and cultivars at various stations of Department of Agriculture (DoA), Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), Agriculture and Forest University (AFU) and private farms until the Fiscal Year 2017/2018. Altogather there were 47 species of fruits from tropical zone of Terai (Tarahara, Janakpur, Sarlahi, Parwanipur and Khajura) to cold temperature zone of high hills (Marpha, Rajikot and Satbanj) across the country. Apple diversity was found at Horticulture Research Station, Rajikot, Jumla and has introduced 25 spur type cultivars. National Citrus Research Programme (NCRP), Dhankuta was citrus most diversity areas and has maintained 130 exotic and indigenous germplasms of citrus species followed by NCFD, Kirtipur. Mango diversity was noted at RARS, Tarahara (16 cultivars), RARS, Parwanipur (25 cultivars), Farm of DoA-Sarlahi (30 cultivars), Farms of DoA-Janakpur (18 cultivars), AFU-Rampur (17 cultivars). Some of the private nurseries like Everything Organic Nursery, Patlekhet, Kavre and international organization like Technology Demonstration Centre of ICIMOD, Godawari, Lalitpur were also found to be a diversity centre of many exotic and indigenous germplasms of fruit species. These indigenous fruit genetic resources were also used to develop varieties such as Sunkagati-1 and Sunkagati-2 and Tehrathum Local of acid lime, Khoku Local of mandarin orange, 'Malbhog' of banana which were notified by the National Seed Board, SQCC. The unique fruit genetic resources were „Pharping Local‟ (Asian sand pear), „Sindhuli Junar‟ (sweet orange), „Dhankuta Local‟ and „Manakamana Local‟ (mandarin), Local Malbhog (banana), Bhaktapure Lapsi (Nepalese hog plum) etc. which have superior traits than exotic fruits. Unique and wild fruit species were yellow, black and red raspberries (Rubus ellipticus, R. foliolosus and R. acuminatus respectively), bale (Aegle marmelos), pummelo (Citrus grandis), citron (Citrus medica), sweet lime (Citrus limettoides), butter tree or chiuri (Basia buttyacea), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), black plum (Syzygium cumini), wild apple (Mallus baccata), rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri), bayberry (Myrica esculanta), edimayal (Pyrus pashia), black and white ebony (Diospyrus malbarica), wild species of olive (Olea ferruginea and O. glandulifera), wild kiwifruit (Actinidia callosa) etc. Most of the diversity studies were based on phenotypic descriptions. We believe that the number of species and genotypes listed in this article would be increased if detail survey is further carried out. Way forward to utilize these valuable genetic resources has also been discussed in this manuscript.",

        "abstract": "Pigmentation is involved in a wide array of biological functions across insect orders, including body patterning, thermoregulation, and immunity. The melanin pathway, in particular, has been characterized in several species. However, molecular evolution of the genes involved in this pathway is poorly characterized, and their roles in pigmentation of early developmental stages are just beginning to be explored in non-model organisms. We traced the molecular evolution of six melanin pathway genes in 53 species of Lepidoptera covering butterflies and moths, and representing over 100 million years of diversification. We compared the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions within and between these genes to study signatures of selection at the level of individual sites, genes, and branches of the gene tree. We found that molecular evolution of all six genes was governed by strong purifying selection. Yet, a number of sites showed signs of being under positive selection, including in the highly conserved domain regions of three genes. Further, we traced the expression of these genes across developmental stages, tissues, and sexes in the Papilio polytes butterfly using a developmental transcriptome dataset. We observed that the expression patterns of the genes in P. polytes largely reflected their known tissue-specific function in other species. The expression of sequentially acting genes in the melanin pathway was correlated. Interestingly, four out of six melanin pathway genes (ebony, pale, aaNAT, and DDC) showed a sexually dimorphic pattern of developmental heterochrony; i.e., females showed peak activity much earlier in pupal development compared to that of males. Our evolutionary and developmental analyses suggest that the vast diversity of wing patterning and pigmentation in Lepidoptera may have been aided largely by differential developmental regulation of genes in a highly conserved pathway, in which the sequence evolution of individual genes is highly constrained.",

        "title": "Historical formation of the originality of an American choral tradition of the second half of the XX century",
        "abstract": "Background. Choral work of American composers of the second half of the XX century is characterized by new qualities that have appeared because of not only musical but also non-musical factors generated by the system of cultural, historical and social conditions. Despite of a serious amount of scientific literature on the history of American music, the choral layer of American music remains partially unexplored, especially, in Ukrainian musical science, that bespeaks the science and practical novelty of the research results. The purpose of this study is to discover and to analyze the peculiarities of the historical formation and identity of American choral art of the second half of the twentieth century using the the works of famous American artists as examples. The research methodology is based on theoretical, historical and analytical methods, generalization and specification. Results. The general picture of the development of American composers’ practice in the genre of choral music is characterized by genre and style diversity. In our research we present portraits of iconic figures of American choral music in the period under consideration. So, the choral works of William Dawson (1899–1990), one of the most famous African-American composers, are characterized by the richness of the choral texture, intense sonority and demonstration of his great understanding of the vocal potential of the choir. Dawson was remembered, especially, for the numerous arrangements of spirituals, which do not lose their popularity. Aaron Copland (1899–1990), which was called “the Dean of American Composers”, was one of the founder of American music “classical” style, whose name associated with the America image in music. Despite the fact that the composer tends to atonalism, impressionism, jazz, constantly uses in his choral opuses sharp dissonant sounds and timbre contrasts, his choral works associated with folk traditions, written in a style that the composer himself called “vernacular”, which is characterized by a clearer and more melodic language. Among Copland’s famous choral works are “At The River”, “Four Motets”, “In the Beginning”, “Lark”, “The Promise of Living”; “Stomp Your Foot” (from “The Tender Land”), “Simple Gifts”, “Zion’s Walls” and others. Dominick Argento’s (1927–2019) style is close to the style of an Italian composer G. C. Menotti. Argento’s musical style, first of all, distinguishes the dominance of melody, so he is a leading composer in the genre of lyrical opera. Argento’s choral works are distinguished by a variety of performers’ stuff: from a cappella choral pieces – “A Nation of Cowslips”, “Easter Day” for mixed choir – to large-scale works accompanied by various instruments: “Apollo in Cambridge”, “Odi et Amo”, “Jonah and the Whale”, “Peter Quince at the Clavier”, “Te Deum”, “Tria Carmina Paschalia”, “Walden Pond”. For the choir and percussion, Argento created “Odi et Amo” (“I Hate and I Love”), 1981, based on the texts of the ancient Roman poet Catullus, which testifies to the sophistication of the composer’s literary taste and his skill in reproducing complex psychological states. The most famous from Argento’s spiritual compositions is “Te Deum” (1988), where the Latin text is combined with medieval English folk poetry, was recorded and nominated for a Grammy Award. Among the works of Samuel Barber’s (1910–1981) vocal and choral music were dominating. His cantata “Prayers of Kierkegaard”, based on the lyrics of four prayers by this Danish philosopher and theologian, for solo soprano, mixed choir and symphony orchestra is an example of an eclectic trend. Chapter I “Thou Who art unchangeable” traces the imitation of a traditional Gregorian male choral singing a cappella. Chapter II “Lord Jesus Christ, Who suffered all lifelong” for solo soprano accompanied by oboe solo is an example of minimalism. Chapter III “Father in Heaven, well we know that it is Thou” reflects the traditions of Russian choral writing. William Schumann (1910–1992) stands among the most honorable and prominent American composers. In 1943, he received the first Pulitzer Prize for Music for Cantata No 2 “A Free Song”, based on lyrics from the poems by Walt Whitman. In his choral works, Schumann emphasized the lyrics of American poetry. Norman Luboff (1917–1987), the founder and conductor of one of the leading American choirs in the 1950–1970s, is one of the great American musicians who dared to dedicate most of their lives to the popular media cultures of the time. Holiday albums of Christmas Songs with the Norman Luboff Choir have been bestselling for many years. In 1961, Norman Luboff Choir received the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Chorus. Luboff’s productive work on folk song arrangements, which helped to preserve these popular melodies from generation to generation, is considered to be his main heritage. The choral work by Leonard Bernstein (1918–1990) – a great musician – composer, pianist, brilliant conductor – is represented by such works as “Chichester Psalms”, “Hashkiveinu”, “Kaddish” Symphony No 3)”,”The Lark (French & Latin Choruses)”, “Make Our Garden Grow (from Candide)”, “Mass”. “Chichester Psalms”, where the choir sings lyrics in Hebrew, became Bernstein’s most famous choral work and one of the most successfully performed choral masterpieces in America. An equally popular composition by Bernstein is “Mass: A Theater Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers”, which was dedicated to the memory of John F. Kennedy, the stage drama written in the style of a musical about American youth in searching of the Lord. More than 200 singers, actors, dancers, musicians of two orchestras, three choirs are involved in the performance of “Mass”: a four-part mixed “street” choir, a four-part mixed academic choir and a two-part boys’ choir. The eclecticism of the music in the “Mass” shows the versatility of the composer’s work. The composer skillfully mixes Latin texts with English poetry, Broadway musical with rock, jazz and avant-garde music. Choral cycles by Conrad Susa (1935–2013), whose entire creative life was focused on vocal and dramatic music, are written along a story line or related thematically. Bright examples of his work are “Landscapes and Silly Songs” and “Hymns for the Amusement of Children”; the last cycle is an fascinating staging of Christopher Smart’s poetry (the18 century). The composer’s music is based on a synthesis of tonal basis, baroque counterpoint, polyphony and many modern techniques and idioms drawn from popular music. The cycle “Songs of Innocence and of Experience”, created by a composer and a pianist William Bolcom (b. 1938) on the similar-titled poems by W. Blake, represents musical styles from romantic to modern, from country to rock. More than 200 vocalists take part in the performance of this work, in academic choruses (mixed, children’s choirs) and as soloists; as well as country, rock and folk singers, and the orchestral musicians. This composition successfully synthesizes an impressive range of musical styles: reggae, classical music, western, rock, opera and other styles. Morten Lauridsen (b. 1943) was named “American Choral Master” by the National Endowment for the Arts (2006). The musical language of Lauridsen’s compositions is very diverse: in his Latin sacred works, such as “Lux Aeterna” and “Motets”, he often refers to Gregorian chant, polyphonic techniques of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and mixes them with modern sound. Lauridsen’s “Lux Aeterna” is a striking example of the organic synthesis of the old and the new traditions, or more precisely, the presentation of the old in a new way. At the same time, his other compositions, such as “Madrigali” and “Cuatro Canciones”, are chromatic or atonal, addressing us to the technique of the Renaissance and the style of postmodernism. Conclusions. Analysis of the choral work of American composers proves the idea of moving the meaningful centers of professional choral music, the gradual disappearance of the contrast, which had previously existed between consumer audiences, the convergence of positions of “third direction” music and professional choral music. In the context of globalization of society and media culture, genre and stylistic content, spiritual meanings of choral works gradually tend to acquire new features such as interaction of ancient and modern musical systems, traditional and new, modified folklore and pop. There is a tendency to use pop instruments or some stylistic components of jazz, such as rhythm and intonation formula, in choral compositions. Innovative processes, metamorphosis and transformations in modern American choral music reveal its integration specificity, which is defined by meta-language, which is formed basing on interaction and dialogue of different types of thinking and musical systems, expansion of the musical sound environment, enrichment of acoustic possibilities of choral music, globalization intentions. Thus, the actualization of new cultural dominants and the synthesis of various stylistic origins determine the specificity of American choral music.",

        "abstract": "Fretboards of string instruments are usually made of rare woods that commonly have a high density, strength, and hardness; further, they are wear resistant, uniform in texture, and feature an elegant color. To reduce the consumption of scarce timber resources, especially of endangered tropical hardwood species, suitable replacement materials should be identified. The substitute can be either common tree species having similar characteristics, or fast-growing plantation wood that has undergone modifications to match the performance of precious woods. This study compares the anatomical structure, physical features, mechanical properties, and surface color of three precious woods traditionally used in fretboards (ebony, Indian rosewood, and African blackwood) against maple, which is used for the backboard, ribs, and necks of string instruments. Based on the data, a set of performance evaluation indices for selecting alternative materials for fretboards is proposed. In specific, the replacement wood should be a diffuse-porous tropical hardwood with few vessels and a smaller diameter, thick fibrous walls, and a cell wall rate of more than 50%. In terms of physical properties, it should have low swelling coefficients for moisture and water absorption, and dimensional stability. The replacement should also display hardness values greater than 9.0 kN in the cross-section and greater than 6.0 kN in the tangential and radial sections. Further, it should have a high modulus of rupture (> 149 MPa) and elasticity (> 14.08 GPa), good impact bending strength, and good wear resistance (80–150 mg/100 r). To satisfy the traditional aesthetics, the wood surface color should be black, dark brown, or dark purple-brown, with colorimetric parameters in the range of 0.0 < L* < 30.0, 0.0 < b* < 6.0, and an a* value as small as possible. The evaluation indicators used for searching potential high-quality alternative tree species are not the same as those for replacing traditional fretboard materials using modified fast-growing plantation wood. The physical and mechanical properties and the surface color of traditional precious fretboard wood are important evaluation indicators for whether the modified fast-growing plantation wood can replace the traditional fretboard wood.",

        "title": "ebony affects pigmentation divergence and cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila americana and D. novamexicana",
        "abstract": "Drosophila pigmentation has been a fruitful model system for understanding the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying phenotypic evolution. For example, prior work has shown that divergence of the tan gene contributes to pigmentation differences between two members of the virilis group: Drosophila novamexicana, which has a light yellow body color, and D. americana, which has a dark brown body color. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and expression analysis has suggested that divergence of the ebony gene might also contribute to pigmentation differences between these two species. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate ebony null mutants in D. americana and D. novamexicana and then using reciprocal hemizygosity testing to compare the effects of each species’ ebony allele on pigmentation. We find that divergence of ebony does indeed contribute to the pigmentation divergence between species, with effects on both the overall body color as well as a difference in pigmentation along the dorsal abdominal midline. Motivated by recent work in D. melanogaster, we also used the ebony null mutants to test for effects of ebony on cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles. We found that ebony affects CHC abundance in both species, but does not contribute to qualitative differences in the CHC profiles between these two species. Additional transgenic resources for working with D. americana and D. novamexicana, such as white mutants of both species and yellow mutants in D. novamexicana, were generated in the course of this work and are also described. Taken together, this study advances our understanding of loci contributing to phenotypic divergence and illustrates how the latest genome editing tools can be used for functional testing in non-model species.",

        "title": "Micropropagation and Effect of Phloroglucinol on Rooting of Diospyros crassiflora Hiern",
        "abstract": "The jet-black to streaked ebony wood produced by the African ebony (Diospyros crassiflora Hiern, Ebenaceae) is exploited in Central and West Africa. A conservation effort is currently underway in Cameroon to propagate the tree through seedlings and cuttings. However, the intermittent availability of its seeds and the long time required for rooting formation of cuttings are limiting its propagation. This study aims to develop a successful protocol for ebony micropropagation. In vitro culture of nodal segments from seedlings was performed in half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with either zeatin (0.0, 2.3, 4.6, 9.1, 13.7, 18.2, 22.8, and 27.4 µm) or 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (0.0, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8, 13.3, 17.8, 22.2, and 26.6 µm). After 12 weeks, all media allowed shoot budbreak. Shoots displaying the greatest budbreak were observed with 22.8 µm zeatin and 22.2 µm BAP. The shoots were then transferred to a medium supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and phloroglucinol (PG) at different concentrations for root induction. Root induction was observed on the shoots initially induced in the medium with BAP, but not in those grown in the medium with zeatin. In half-strength MS supplemented with 396.5 µm PG plus 14.2 µm IBA, the formation of a single tap root was observed on 79% of shoots, with an average root length of 2.8 ± 0.18 cm. Rooted plants were successfully acclimatized to the greenhouse, with a 50% survival rate. This is the first report on Diospyros crassiflora micropropagation, which paves the way for rapid ebony multiplication to respond to needed conservation efforts.",

This study aims to characterize and determine the antioxidant activity of secondary metabolites of ethyl acetate fraction from ebony bark. Ethyl acetate extract was fractionated using Liquid Vacum Chromatography (KVC) and Gravity Column Chromatography (KKG). The isolated compounds were characterized using UV-Vis and IR spectrophotometers. Data on maximum absorption of λmax 273 nm from UV-Vis analysis showed the presence of chromophore phenol. IR spectral data showed several specific peaks, among others, at wave number (ʋ) of 3425.58 cm-1 indicating the presence of –OH group, C-H aliphatic bond at ʋ of  2924.09 cm-1  and 2854.65 cm-1, and the peak at ʋ of 1604.77 -1465.90 cm-1 and 3078.39 cm-1 indicated the aromatic group, reinforcing the assumption that the isolates produced were phenolic compounds. IC50 value of 75.47 µg/mL from antioxidant activity testing showed that the isolates obtained were antioxidant compounds with strong antioxidant categories. \nKeywords: antioxidant, Diospyros, ebony, phenolic, isolation",

        "abstract": "There are several underexploited plant seeds or fruits in Nigeria with little information about their chemical composition. To this end a comprehensive study on fatty acid, phospholipids and phytosterols composition of bitter melon (Momordica charaantia) fruit and ebony tree (Diospyros mespiliformis) fruit pulp were determined using standard analytical techniques. The most concentrated fatty acid (%) was linoleic acid in Momordica charantia fruit (45.47) and 44.82 in Diospyros mespiliformis fruit pulp. The increasing order of the concentrated fatty acids in Momordica charantia fruit were: linolenic acid (2.38) < stearic acid (7.52) < oleic acid (20.18) < palmitic acid (23.64) < linoleic acid (45.47) while that of Diospyros mespiliformis fruit pulp were: linolenic acid (5.73) < stearic acid (8.62) < oleic acid (18.95) < palmitic acid (20.88) < linoleic acid (44.82). Arachidonic, arachidic, palmitoleic, margaric, behenic, erucic, lignoceric, myristic, lauric, capric and caprylic acids were present in small quantities with none of them recording up to 1.0% in both of the two samples. The results also showed low concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (20.41%) in Momordica charantia fruit and 19.13% in Diospyros mespiliformis fruit pulp, and values of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) were 2.44 and 5.78% for the two samples, respectively. The respective phospholipids composition showed a highest concentration of phosphatidylcholine in Momordica charantia and Diospyros mespiliformis (100.31and 88.12 mg/100 g) while lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were the least concentrate values of 12.62 and 14.52 mg/100 g in Momordicacharantia and Diospyros mespiliformis, respectively. The concentrations of phytosterols were of low values except in sitosterol with values of 153.28 and 119.46 mg/100 g in Momordica charantia and Diospyros mespiliformis, respectively. This study provides an informative lipid profile that will serve as a basis for further chemical investigations and nutritional evaluation of Momordica charantia fruit and Diospyros mespiliformis fruit pulp.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of the linguistic matter in the literature of resistance compared to the Standard English pattern. In the first moment, specific relations of the Black Vernacular English are used in details in order to display the resistance of the theme in Morrison’s writing in comparison to the Standard English pattern. The corpus chosen for this article is Beloved , by Toni Morrison, in which the use of African American Vernacular English dialect, studied by Labov among other scholars, is present. The author circumscribes her writing on the civil rights movement recommended by Martin Luther King. Such linguistic characteristics that permeate Morrison’s text are peculiar to a select group of speakers, perpetuated by the segregation established by the white majority, and for being present at the literary materiality it demonstrates its chronological and sociological nature of resistance.",

        "abstract": "Lagerstroemia indica is an important ornamental tree worldwide. The development of cultivars with colorful leaves and increased ornamental value represents one of the current main research topics. We investigated the anthocyanin profiles in two contrasting cultivars for leaf color phenotypes and explored the underlying molecular basis. Both cultivars display purple-red young leaves (Stage 1), and when the leaves mature (Stage 2), they turn green in HD (Lagerstroemia Dynamite) but remain unchanged in ZD (Lagerstroemia Ebony Embers). Seven different anthocyanins were detected, and globally, the leaves of ZD contained higher levels of anthocyanins than those of HD at the two stages with the most pronounced difference observed at Stage 2. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that in contrast to HD, ZD tends to keep a higher activity level of key genes involved in the flavonoid–anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways throughout the leaf developmental stages in order to maintain the synthesis, accumulation, and modification of anthocyanins. By applying gene co-expression analysis, we detected 19 key MYB regulators were co-expressed with the flavonoid–anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and were found strongly down-regulated in HD. This study lays the foundation for the artificial manipulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis in order to create new L. indica cultivars with colorful leaves and increased ornamental value.",

Each site has various streak pattern in which the industry classified it into two streak types namely batang macis (BM) and sarang laba-laba/bendera (SL). This research was conducted to investigate the influence of site on streak patterns and several physical properties of the heartwood of ebony. Ebony from Parigi has BM streaks pattern and meet the grade B-A, meanwhile ebony from Poso has SL streaks pattern, qualified for grade C only. On the basis of t-test, only L* (lightness-darkness) was differed between the two streak patterns, while wood density and initial moisture content were not differed significantly. The BM streaks pattern has a darker of heartwood color, higher density but lower initial moisture content.",

        "abstract": "Initial water leaching affects were studied relative to the rot resistance of 21 tropical wood species to the brown-rot fungus Coniophora puteana and the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor. The rot resistance of tropical woods, determined by their weight loss (∆m) at 6-weeks fungal attack, was differently influenced by the initial water leaching, as follows: in the 1st group of eight durable species (dark red meranti, macassar ebony, cerejeira, merbau, santos rosewood, zebrano, wengé, and karri) there occurred a very significant decrease of their high rot resistance (with statistical confidence in the range 99 to 99.9% for different species); in the 2nd group of 10 durable species (ipé, yellow balau, doussié, bubinga, ovengol, padouk, iroko, blue gum, maçaranduba, and makoré) there did not occur a decrease of their high rot resistance; and in the 3rd group of three less durable species (okoumé, tineo, sapelli) a weaker rot resistance did not change due to leaching. The durable tropical woods (18 species from the 1st and 2nd groups) were more resistant to the brown-rot fungus (∆mC.p.-average = 0.72%) than the white-rot fungus (∆mT.v.-average = 1.07%). However, this phenomenon was no longer apparent after water leaching (∆mC.p.-Leached-average = 2.61%; ∆mT.v.-Leached-average = 2.32%).",

This study \nwas a descriptive qualitative by taken into account of stylistics categories and mind \nstyle which were applied to the Alice Walker’s The Color Purple. The data of this study \nwere taken from Alice Walker’s novel entitled The Color Purple. The result of the study \nshowed the occurrences and the forms of regularities in the novel The Color Purple by \nAlice Walker which represented the style of the novelist in creating her literary work. \nThe bold character of African-American Vernacular English that were found in Alice \nWalker’s The Color Purple showed that the novelist poured their mind style in their \nliterary works by showing their stylistic options in producing the novel. By showing their \nwriting style the novelists were contributed to the development of national language \nin America.",

        "title": "Ebony Wood Identification to Battle Illegal Trade",
        "abstract": "Illegal logging is a serious global issue. It is not only a great threat to rare forest species, but also contributes to the current biodiversity crisis and climate change. Despite international agreements, 10-30% of all imported wood has been illegally logged. Many of these trees, especially rosewood (Dalbergia) and ebony (Diospyros), are very important for the global market because of their high economic value. Ebony is a common name for the black heartwood (inner parts of the stem) of some Diospyros species. These woods are used in products such as acoustic musical instruments. The genus Diospyros includes over 700 species globally. More than 200 of them are endemic to Madagascar, which is a one of the richest regions in terms of biodiversity. This island is situated in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Eastern Africa and is known for its unique biodiversity.\n Due to over-harvesting in recent decades, many Malagasy species of Diospyros are listed as endangered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES; CITES checklist for Diospyros). Trade of these species requires CITES permits. All described Malagasy ebony species under Appendix II meaning that, while not currently threatened with extinction they may become so if trade is not controlled. Controlling the logging trade is often more difficult than it seems. Labels are easily switched, different species of wood can be mixed, permits can be falsified, and many more tricks are used to get illegally logged wood onto the global market.\n One of the most commonly used techniques to identify timber products is the assessment of species-specific cellular patterns (White et al. 1991). Wood anatomy has been practiced for more than 200 years, and automated tools have been developed to identify wood at the genus and species level over the past decade (Figueroa-Mata et al. 2018, Hafemann et al. 2014, Koch et al. 2011, Ravindran et al. 2018). However, the lack of sufficient resolution for species-level identification, especially for speciose genera such as Diospyros, is the main drawback of this method. Identification using molecular barcoding is an alternative but challenging method as timber is composed mainly of dead cells and the few living cells often have poor DNA quality. A third identification method is direct analysis in real time time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART TOF MS; Espinoza et al. 2015, Evans et al. 2017). This method analyses the chemical composition of a wood sample, resulting in a species-specific chemical fingerprint. DART TOF MS has already been successfully applied to several tree genera including Dalbergia (rosewood), Aquilaria (agarwood), and Quercus (oak). The main disadvantage of this method is that it can only be applied to heartwood samples from the inner part of the trunk.\n In order to develop a comprehensive and accurate identification tool to identify Malagasy ebony woods, we are working towards building an image recognition model based on wood anatomical microscopic images. As a case study, we successfully trained our classifier using a public dataset (Martins et al. 2012) such that our model was able to distinguish different tree genera of that dataset with 93% accuracy. We are currently extending this work to the subgeneric level of Diospyros. This will be used to establish the presence of ebony woods in acoustic musical instruments based on reference samples from wood specimens preserved in natural history musea. To achieve sufficient accuracy, we are focusing on the microscopic features of transverse and tangential orientation planes in ebony woods. Our database will include very high resolution images of Diospyros species, and can help wood anatomist at wood identification institute and customs officers at harbours to increase the accuracy of the identification of illegally logged ebony woods.",

        "abstract": "Perception is a particularly interesting and quite diverse phenomenon. It mainly depends on different interpretations presented by recipients. This work aims at constituting a cross-sectional list of analyses of attitudes presented by Warsaw society during contact with sculptures of Makonde artists. Thanks to the support of PTAfr and the courtesy of the Library in Koszykowa Street, on 16-19 January, and on 24 January 2018, research was carried out in reference to the exhibition titled: «Miedzy sztuką a opetaniem. Hebanowe bestiarium ludu Makonde. Fotografie Piotra Sadurskiego» [Between Art and Possession. Ebony bestiary of Makonde people. Piotr Sadurski Photography]. During the exhibition, sculptures from the collection of Ewa and Eugeniusz Rzewuski entered into the artistic dialogue with photographs by Piotr Sadurski. All the exhibited works were mainly in the style of shetani, referring to demonic presentations. Makonde sculptures are an example of contemporary art of East Africa. Their roots should be sought in indigenous traditions and beliefs. Makonde artists come from Mozambique, but as a result of social unrest many of them were forced to leave their homeland. They found themselves safe in Tanzania, where a large part of Makonde people live and create in the Dar Es Salaam area until today. The exhibition featured sculptures of the most outstanding representatives of this trend. Within the research, the respondents attending the exhibition were presented with photographs made in two distinct stylistic conventions: chiaroscuro one and formal one. The primary objective of this is to show some ways of perception of Makonde artists' sculptures, distant in terms of culture, by respondents participating in the Warsaw research. Keywords: perception, East Africa, Makonde, contemporary art of Tanzania.",

        "abstract": "Though Sri Lanka belongs to one of the 34 biodiversity hotspots of the world, its microfolora specially fungi are not well studied and underrepresented in the global literature. Here we report the fungal species diversity of decaying hardwood of a Sri Lankan dry zone forest for the first time. Decaying hardwoods were collected from historically important Dimbulagala forest reserve, Sri Lanka and fungi associated with these woods were isolated. Out of 35 fungal species identified using morphological and molecular methods, 11 species were first records in Sri Lanka. All the tested isolates were able to utilize wood as the sole carbon source and produced varying degrees of laccase. Isolates of Perenniporia tephropora, Coriolopsis caperata, Gymnopilus dilepis, Fusarium solani and Vanderbylia fraxinea were among the top six laccase producers. Except Fusarium solani, the rest of the isolates showed more than 70% decolorization of the of triphenylmethane dye and there was a significant positive correlation between laccase production and dye decolorization. To the best of our knowledge laccase production and dye decolorization ability of Vanderbylia fraxinea and Gymnopilus dilepis have never been reported in the fungal kingdom before. Perenniporia tephropora was isolated from one of the strongest decay resistant hardwood species, Ebony (Diospyros ebenum) also known as dark wood and V. fraxinea was isolated from another medicinally important hardwood Neem (Azadirachta indica). Findings of this study confirms that decaying hardwood of Sri Lanka provide unexplode a unique niche for discovering fungal species with biotechnological applications such as high laccase producers and dye decolorizers.",

        "abstract": "Conforme Straus (2014), certos procedimentos composicionais de Stravinsky podem ser entendidos por meio da elaboração de duas camadas simultâneas de prolongamento de quintas justas separadas por algum intervalo. Lerdahl (2001) sugere um tipo de hierarquia tonal que pode ser modelada por um espaço multidimensional, no qual determinada distância espacial equivalerá à distância cognitiva. Acolhendo conceitos de Lerdahl (2001) e Straus (2014), este trabalho busca investigar aspectos qualitativos da simultaneidade multiespacial na música de Stravinsky, atentando-se especialmente a passagens de Ragtime for Eleven Instruments (1918), Preludium for Jazz Ensemble (1937), Tango (1940) e Ebony Concerto (1945), obras orientadas pela influência da música popular americana. Este artigo se detém aos desdobramentos da questão da simultaneidade em processos composicionais de Stravinsky, sobretudo mediante aquilo que denominamos como “prolongamentos simultâneos multicêntricos”. Este artigo busca ampliar tal discussão pelo intermédio de uma perspectiva teórica baseada principalmente na ideia de prolongamento estrutural provida pela teoria neoschenkeriana.",

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the now well-known and preserved examples of furniture found in several per-djet of ancient Egypt’s Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2160 BCE) and New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BCE) it was possible to analyze in detail each object uncovered, revealing how it was built, the composing materials, the techniques that maintained it together and other elements present in its composition. The most interesting fact for this study is that, upon analysis, there seems to be interesting similarities between construction techniques used to assemble both ancient furniture and the ones used nowadays for the same purposes. To test the hypothesis, this paper is focused in three particular objects, the Solid Ebony Chair of Tutankhamun JE 62033, from KV62, and the Chairs of Hetepheres MFA 38.957 and JE 53263 , from G7000X, -a much older chair- and analyses its structures, the materials and techniques used to assemble them, the similarities and dissimilarities, if any, between these two examples and to see if the is any correlations with them and their analog structures built three and a half millennia later, in our current days.",

        "abstract": "Because of the ways fandom is constructed as white, Black fans are often overlooked or marginalized. Black Game of Thrones (2011–) fans create a parallel culturally resonant fandom organized around an African American Vernacular English–inflected iteration of the show's title, Dem Thrones. Through podcast recaps and the use of nonstandard hashtags for live tweeting, these fans draw on the affordances of digital media to create enclaved fan spaces. In addition to creating parallel and sequestered fandoms, Dem Thrones fans also engage in culturally resonant fan practices that use Black cultural commonplaces and center Black experiences. Dem Thrones fans draw on vernaculars and Black cult media to interpret the show through Black cultural lenses. They also use strategies for reading otherwise absent Black cultural specificity into the text. Seizing on resemblances to Black linguistic, aesthetic, or social practices, Dem Thrones fan map Black culture onto a text, creating opportunities for identification despite a dearth of Black representation.",

        "abstract": "Colour patterns in butterflies and moths are crucial traits for adaptation. Previous investigations have highlighted genes responsible for pigmentation (ie yellow and ebony). However, the mechanisms by which these genes are regulated in lepidopteran insects remain poorly understood. To elucidate this, molecular studies involving dipterans have largely analysed the cis‐regulatory regions of pigmentation genes and have revealed cis‐regulatory modularity. Here, we used well‐developed transgenic techniques in Bombyx mori and demonstrated that cis‐regulatory modularity controls tissue‐specific expression of the yellow gene. We first identified which body parts are regulated by the yellow gene via black pigmentation. We then isolated three discrete regulatory elements driving tissue‐specific gene expression in three regions of B. mori larvae. Finally, we found that there is no apparent sequence conservation of cis‐regulatory regions between B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster, and no expression driven by the regulatory regions of one species when introduced into the other species. Therefore, the trans‐regulatory landscapes of the yellow gene differ significantly between the two taxa. The results of this study confirm that lepidopteran species use cis‐regulatory modules to control gene expression related to pigmentation, and represent a powerful cadre of transgenic tools for studying evolutionary developmental mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In this study, proximate, mineral, amino acid and anti–nutrient compositions of Mormodica charantia fruit and Diospyros mespiliformis fruit pulp were determined using standard analytical techniques. The respective proximate composition values (g/100 g sample) of M. charantia and D. mespiliformis were: Moisture (3.88 and 4.64), ash (5.22 and 5.5.13), crude protein (20.36 and 4.68), crude fibre (8.41 and 3.58), ether extract (4.39 and 2.00), and carbohydrate by difference (57.56 and 79.68). The calculated fatty acids and metabolizable energy for M. charantia and D. mespiliformis were (3.51 and 1.60 %) and (148.07 and 1508.12 kJ/100 g). The most abundant minerals were Na (612.42 and 425.21 mg/100 g) followed by Na (521.71 and 368.25 mg/100g), respectively. Generally, the two samples were found to be good sources of essential minerals. The levels of Na/K and Ca/Mg ratios were desirable compared with recommended values. The amino acid profiles revealed that both samples contained nutritionally useful quantities of most of the essential amino acids with total essential amino acid (TEAA) (with His) were 34.38 and 22.37 g/100 g for Mormodica charantia and Diospyros mespiliformis, respectively. However, essential amino acid supplementation may be required in dietary formula except Ile and Leu in Mormodica charantia and Met + Cys and Val in Diospyros mespiliformis when comparing the essential amino acids (EAAs) in this report with the recommended FAO/WHO provisional pattern. Met + Cys (TSAA) was the first limiting amino acids (LAA) for the two plant fruits. The study showed that Mormodica charantia and Diospyros mespiliformis can be better sources of some of the essential nutrients with potential health beneficial constituents than some of the members of the family to which they belong. However, some of the anti–nutrient contents may pose nutritional problems in their consumption.",

        "abstract": "Pleiotropic genes are genes that affect more than one trait. For example, many genes required for pigmentation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also affect traits such as circadian rhythms, vision, and mating behavior. Here, we present evidence that two pigmentation genes, ebony and tan, which encode enzymes catalyzing reciprocal reactions in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, also affect cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) composition in D. melanogaster females. More specifically, we report that ebony loss-of-function mutants have a CHC profile that is biased toward long (>25C) chain CHCs, whereas tan loss-of-function mutants have a CHC profile that is biased toward short (<25C) chain CHCs. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of dopamine synthesis, a key step in the melanin synthesis pathway, reversed the changes in CHC composition seen in ebony mutants, making the CHC profiles similar to those seen in tan mutants. These observations suggest that genetic variation affecting ebony and/or tan activity might cause correlated changes in pigmentation and CHC composition in natural populations. We tested this possibility using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and found that CHC composition covaried with pigmentation as well as levels of ebony and tan expression in newly eclosed adults in a manner consistent with the ebony and tan mutant phenotypes. These data suggest that the pleiotropic effects of ebony and tan might contribute to covariation of pigmentation and CHC profiles in Drosophila.",

        "abstract": "Using positioning theory and Bourdieu’s theories on speaker legitimacy, this article explores the link between identity and speech in the context of a YouTube video entitled Vlog 29: Ugly Girls by DavidSoComedy. By positioning himself as a legitimate speaker of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Korean-American YouTuber DavidSoComedy effectively changes this form of English from an ethnic identity marker to a social identity marker. The article thus continues in the tradition of more recent researchers that have suggested that identity, and the languages associated with that identity, are fluid and ever-changing, rather than fixed.",

        "abstract": "Aim. Analysis of the chronic effects of caffeine and laser radiation on starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster, in depends on the genotype. Methods. The experiments were carried out in wild type stocks of Drosophila melanogaster: Canton-S and Oregon; mutant stock ebony and stocks with mutation ebony saturated by stocks Canton-S and Oregon – ebonyC-S and ebonyOr. Caffeine was applied in concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the cultural medium. Flies were exposed to He-Ne laser light of wavelength 632.8 nm and surface power density 0.03 mW/cm2 for 5 minutes. Control flies were grown under standard living conditions. Results. The lifespan during starvation dependence on a genotype (17.62 % and 19.51 %), external factors (h = 17.02 % and 19.64 %) and on the combined factors – h = 4.37 % and 2.42 % (for males and males, respectively) was shown. Conclusions. Almost in all experimental variants caffeine and laser light induced the extension lifespan during starvation. The simultaneous applying of both factors (caffeine+laser light) induced the maximal lifespan extension in Drosophila stocks C-S, ebony, and ebonyOr. Such additive effect was not observed in ebonyC-S flies. We connect the observed effects of caffeine and laser light with hormesis effect.Keywords: drosophila, genotype, lifespan during starvation, mutation, stress tolerance.",

        "abstract": "Traits with a common genetic basis frequently display correlated phenotypic responses to selection or environmental conditions. In Drosophila melanogaster, pigmentation of the abdomen and a trident‐shaped region on the thorax are genetically correlated. Here, we used a pooled replicated genomewide association approach (Pool‐GWAS) to identify the genetic basis of variation in thoracic trident pigmentation in two Drosophila melanogaster populations. We confirmed the previously reported large effect of ebony and the association of the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne. For the first time, we identified tan as another major locus contributing to variation in trident pigmentation. Intriguingly, the regulatory variants of tan that were most strongly associated with female abdominal pigmentation also showed a strong association with trident pigmentation. We validated this common genetic basis in transgenic assays and found qualitatively similar effects on trident and abdominal pigmentation. Further work is required to determine whether this genetic correlation is favoured by natural selection or reflects a neutral by‐product of a shared regulatory architecture.",

        "abstract": "The molecular underpinnings of pigmentation diversity in Drosophila have recently emerged as a model for understanding how the evolution of different cis-regulatory variants results in common adaptive phenotypes within species. We compared sequence variation in a 5′ regulatory region harboring a modular enhancer containing a ∼0.7-kb core element contributing to abdominal melanisation in African, and a ∼0.5-kb core element contributing to thoracic pigmentation in D. melanogaster from Japan, to tropical and temperate populations from eastern Australia previously shown to be divergent in thoracic pigmentation and ebony expression. The Australian populations exhibited strong association with the core enhancer polymorphism cluster in complete association with Dark and Light phenotypes from Iriomote, Japan. Moreover, the Iriomote Light and Dark core enhancer haplotypes are common to the Australian populations in the direction predicted by pigmentation phenotype. We also confirmed the Japanese patterns of linkage disequilibrium and association of the tropical inversion In(3R)Payne with the Light enhancer haplotype in the Australian tropical light population. A worldwide survey of the ∼0.5-kb ebony control region SNPs and haplotypes in a subset of the Drosophila Genome Nexus (DGN) populations suggest origins in the sub-Saharan ancestral region surrounding Zambia and subsequent invasion following colonization out of Africa. A previous study demonstrated complex within and between population genetic architecture for abdominal pigmentation which is also correlated with thoracic pigmentation in melanized DGN sub-Saharan populations; however, the ∼0.5-kb ebony control region was not associated and both haplotypes are common even in the most intensely pigmented D. melanogaster from high altitude Ethiopia. In the Australian populations, the strong phenotypic association with the enhancer SNPs and haplotypes that at least partly regulates ebony expression in the Iriomote population, our previous work demonstrating opposing clines for thoracic pigmentation and ebony expression, where the expression cline parallels the In(3R)Payne cline, and the concerted evolution of pigmentation intensity and ebony expression under rapid experimental evolution, all point to a common adaptive evolutionary pathway in distinct populations.",

Phytoplankton community in Lake Ebony lives in high organic materials received from domestic waste. A spatio-temporal observation at five sites was carried out to understand the spatial distribution of phytoplankton at each group of time of observation and the succession of phytoplankton. Spatial analysis was carried out to map the distribution pattern of plankton,using ArcGIS 10.1 with IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted) interpolation method. Spatial clustering was determined by Canberra Index. The succession of phytoplankton was shown by graph of Frontier succession models, SDI (rate of succession), and SIMI. There were two clustered groups of site. Based on graph of Frontier succession, phytoplankton in Lake Ebony was at Stage 2 and 3 with the rate of succession ranged from 0.008 to 0.003, and value of SIMI ranged from 0.68 to 0.97. There was different spatial distribution pattern of phytoplankton in three groups of observation time, with low rate of succession.",

        "abstract": "An experiment was established with the aim of evaluating the effects of individual and combined addition of organic amendments and microbial inoculation on ebony (Caesalpilinia ebano) plant growth at nursery. A soil surface sample (0-20 cm) from the city of Medellin, Colombia, was transferred into plastic bags (2 kg/bag) and received three types of previously composted organic amendments (manure from domestic animals –dogs and cats (P)-, plant wastes obtained from tree felling and pruning, and grass cutting (RV) and sewage sludge from the city (B)) in two volumetric proportions (20 and 33%) and inoculum composed by the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoglomus fasciculatum and the mineral solubilizing fungus Mortierella sp. As a reference an uninoculated-and-unamended control was included in this study. The experimental design was completely random, each treatment had 12 replicates. The results indicated that the addition of organic amendments promoted plant growth significantly. However, these effects depended on the type and dose in favor of RV. On the other hand, the inoculation with microorganisms did not have effect on plant growth. The effects were explained as a function of nutrient availability improvement in the substrate with organic amendments and apparently due to a low mycorrhizal dependence of ebony. This paper supports the alternative use of organic amendment generated in the city for improving plant nutrition and growth in urban silviculture.",

        "abstract": "The Ebony Tower (1975) is a self-conscious novella that constitutes a perfect example of John Fowles’s consistent reformulation, throughout his work, of themes—such as the oppositional pair creator versus collector, how birth and social class grant different opportunities in life, the difficulty to communicate—, mythical elements and the existentialist perspective. Considering that the novella follows scrupulously each stage in “the hero’s quest” (Campbell, 1993: 245), the purpose of this article is, firstly, to discuss the mythical elements in the novella and how the characters coincide on and depart from what can be expected from their mythical archetypes. And secondly, to prove that these mythical roles could have a patriarchal shape and may contribute to maintaining subjugated positions for the women whether as muses, collaborators or simply as sexual objects of desire and procreation. \n ",

        "abstract": "The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is an important model insect and agricultural pest.However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing Tribolium genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in Tribolium. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the yellow and ebony body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together,the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in Tribolium and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.",

Information about pollen dispersal patterns of D. celebica have not been previously investigated. This study was aimed to determine pollination type, percentage of selfing and outcrossing, as well as distance of pollen dispersal of D. celebica . This study was conducted at experimental forest of Universitas Hasanuddin, Maros District, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. One hundred and sixty six individuals of D. celebica consisted of adult trees and seedlings were analyzed in this study. Ninety four adult trees were selected to become parent trees. The trees were mapped with GPS coordinates . All samples were genotyped using four SSR markers loci. Parental analysis and determination of pollen dispersal patterns were carried out using Cervus 3.0.3. Results indicated that the evaluated markers were effective for assigning candidate of male parents to all evaluated seedlings. Donated pollens could come from male parents in any directions relative to female parent positions. Pollen dispersal pattern showed outcrossing pollination among different male parents (pollen donated trees). The results indicated that seeds were produced predominatly by outcrossing. Pollen dispersal reached up to 166 m. Pollen related processes were linked through female parents, pollinators availability and ecological environment. Simultaneous use of progeny genotyping, spatially explicit analysis of environmental variables and outcomes of plant–animal interactions, were the key elements for an expanded approach to gene flow analysis considering dispersal via pollen and seeds. Research on pollen dispersal of D. celebica should be carried out in other forest types, such as mixed forest and highland forest.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this paper are to show that quotative like , while relatively new to colloquial varieties of (white) English, is attested in varieties of African speech of the continent (represented by Akan (Asante Twi)) and the diaspora (represented by Anti-American African (AAA)) [1] decades, if not over a century prior. Secondly, we show that there are similar bases for grammaticalization for Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ and AAA like whereby they have gone from showing resemblance/approximation to serving as quotatives. Thus, we provide examples from AAA and Akan (Asante Twi) to demonstrate correlations between the two quotatives using primary text research and analyses based on a variety of sources placing the putative origin of quotative like into the collective African context. In doing so, we find that both AAA quotative like and Akan (Asante Twi) sɛ are attested prior to what seems to be the relatively recent adoption of AAA’s pre-existing quotative into colloquial white American English, which is only first attested in the 1980s. We also find that quotative like and sɛ follow similar trajectories in terms of grammaticalization. In conclusion, we argue that quotative sɛ and like represent a common African source of a similar linguistic phenomenon.   [1] The commonly used term African-American is a marker of the integrationist tradition among Black people in the United States. However, we are of the view that the quotative like construction – before being absorbed into colloquial (white) American speech – was more reflective of the Anti-American African tradition in which Africans consciously and subconsciously maintained a distinct African identity in the face of enslavement, oppression and Eurasian linguistic and cultural hegemony. Also, due to the pioneering work of linguists like Lorenzo Dow Turner (1949), it has been demonstrated that varieties of speech of Africans of the Diaspora have maintained aspects of African languages from throughout the continent while conscientiously and sub-conscientiously remaining distinct from Standard (white) American English – a remarkable feat considering the extenuating circumstances under which they exist. Thus, Anti-American African (AAA) is preferred to other terms in the literature such as so-called African American Vernacular English/Black English.",

        "title": "Changes in the primate trade in indonesian wildlife markets over a 25‐year period: Fewer apes and langurs, more macaques, and slow lorises",
        "abstract": "Indonesia has amongst the highest primate species richness, and many species are included on the country's protected species list, partially to prevent over‐exploitation. Nevertheless traders continue to sell primates in open wildlife markets especially on the islands of Java and Bali. We surveyed 13 wildlife markets in 2012–2014 and combined our results with previous surveys from 1990–2009 into a 122‐survey dataset with 2,424 records of 17 species. These data showed that the diversity of species in trade decreased over time, shifting from rare rainforest‐dwelling primates traded alongside more widespread species that are not confined to forest to the latter type only. In the 1990s and early 2000s orangutans, gibbons and langurs were commonly traded alongside macaques and slow lorises but in the last decade macaques and slow lorises comprised the bulk of the trade. In 2012–2014 we monitored six wildlife markets in Jakarta, Bandung and Garut (all on Java), and Denpasar (Bali). During 51 surveys we recorded 1,272 primates of eight species. Traders offered long‐tailed macaque (total 1,007 individuals) and three species of slow loris (228 individuals) in five of the six markets, whereas they traded ebony langurs (18 individuals), and pig‐tailed macaques (14 individuals) mostly in Jakarta. Pramuka and Jatinegara markets, both in Jakarta, stood out as important hubs for the primate trade, with a clear shift in importance over time from the former to the latter. Slow lorises, orangutans, gibbons and some langurs are protected under Indonesian law, which prohibits all trade in them; of these protected species, only the slow lorises remained common in trade throughout the 25‐year period. Trade in non‐protected macaques and langurs is subject to strict regulations—which market traders did not follow—making all the market trade in primates that we observed illegal. Trade poses a substantial threat to Indonesian primates, and without enforcement, the sheer volume of trade may mean that species of Least Concern or Near Threatened may rapidly decline. Am. J.

        "abstract": "The cuticular skeleton of a butterfly wing scale cell serves both as a substrate for the deposition of pigments and as an exquisitely finely-sculpted material responsible for the production of structural colors. While cuticle rigidity and pigmentation depend to a large extent on the end products of a branched biochemical pathway – the melanin pathway – little is known whether genes in this pathway also play a role in the development of specific scale morphologies that might aid in the development of structural colors. Here we first show that male and female Bicyclus anynana butterflies display differences in scale size and scale morphology but no differences in scale color. Then we use CRISPR/Cas9 to show that knockout mutations in five genes that function in the melanin pathway, TH, DDC, yellow, ebony, and aaNAT, affect both the fine structure and the coloration of the wing scales. Most dramatically, mutations in yellow led to extra horizontal cuticular laminae on the surface of scales, whereas mutations in DDC led to taller and sheet-like vertical cuticular laminae throughout each scale. We identify some of the first genes affecting the development of scale morphology, and whose regulation and pleiotropic effects may be important in creating, as well as limiting, the diversity of structural as well as pigmentary colors observed in butterflies.",

        "abstract": "\" This article centralizes Paule Marshall’s own conception of language and voice as vehicles of acculturation and resistance. Drawing from textual analyses of Brown Girls, Brownstones (1959), The Chosen Place, The Timeless People (1969), her own reflections upon language, and literary scholarship, this article contends that Marshall’s use of language seeks to give voice to the marginalized, pay homage to the “mother poets” who influenced her, and offer a rebuke to a Fanonian “white gaze” in its unapologetic embrace of culture and history. With specific attention to intricacies of Bajan Creole and African American Vernacular English, I show how Marshall preserves the intricate tapestry and potency of black speech as a political instrument. Her embrace of the “beautiful/ugly” offers a framework for understanding the grittiness and grace of the language she employs, a language which reflects the world it describes. This framework can be applied to better understand, for example, the black vernacular’s place (or lack thereof) within political/juridical spaces in the twenty-first century – such as Rachel Jeantel’s testimony in defense of her friend Trayvon Martin –, and digital spaces, such as Black Twitter. I locate her continued relevance in her intentional deployment of language as both resistance and refuge. \"",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to examine changes in the annual number of cigarette advertisements in magazines with a predominantly African-American audience following the broadcast ban on tobacco, and whether fluctuations in cigarette print advertising targeting African Americans during the late-1970s until the mid-1980s were associated with declines in smoking initiation.DesignWe tabulated the annual number of cigarette advertisements from magazines with large African-American readerships (Ebony, Essence, and Jet) from 1960 to 1990. Advertisements were coded depending on whether they featured African-American models. We calculated the incidence rate of regular smoking initiation from 1975 to 1990 for African-American 14–25 years old using data from the 1992–1993, 1995–1996, 1998–1999, and 2001–2002 Tobacco Use Supplements of the Current Population Survey. We examined whether trends in smoking initiation coincided with trends in cigarette advertising practices among African Americans.ResultsThe annual aggregated number of printed cigarette advertisements in Ebony, Essence, and Jet magazines increased at least five-fold starting in 1971, following the broadcast ban on cigarette advertising. A decrease in the percentage of ads by Brown & Williamson that showed African-American models was positively correlated (r = 0.30) with declines in the incidence rate of smoking initiation among African Americans from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.ConclusionThe tobacco industry adapted quickly following the broadcast ban on cigarettes by increasing print advertising in African-American magazines. However, changes in print advertising practices by were associated with declines in smoking initiation among African Americans from the late-1970s to mid-1980s.",

        "abstract": "Flying foxes, the genus Pteropus, are considered viral reservoirs. Their colonial nature and long flight capability enhance their ability to spread viruses quickly. To understand how the viral transmission occurs between flying foxes and other animals, we investigated daytime behavior of the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) in the Leuweung Sancang conservation area, Indonesia, by using instantaneous scan sampling and all-occurrence focal sampling. The data were obtained from 0700 to 1700 hr, during May 11–25, 2016. Almost half of the flying foxes (46.9 ± 10.6% of all recorded bats) were awake and showed various levels of activity during daytime. The potential behaviors driving disease transmission, such as self-grooming, mating/courtship and aggression, peaked in the early morning. Males were more active and spent more time on sexual activities than females. There was no significant difference in time spent for negative social behaviors between sexes. Positive social behaviors, especially maternal cares, were performed only by females. Sexual activities and negative/positive social behaviors enable fluid exchange between bats and thus facilitate intraspecies transmission. Conflicts for living space between the flying foxes and the ebony leaf monkey (Trachypithecus auratus) were observed, and this caused daily roosting shifts of flying foxes. The ecological interactions between bats and other wildlife increase the risk of interspecies infection. This study provides the details of the flying fox’s behavior and its interaction with other wildlife in South-East Asia that may help explain how pathogen spillover occurs in the wild.",

It is a wood with technological and organoleptic characteristics that give excellent quality and significant future potential. For this reason study objectives were: (1) deepen the knowledge of anatomical qualities of the wood and bark; (2) analyze sapwood-heartwood ratio, and (3) characterize the growth rings. The study was conducted using samples from Guasayan, Santiago del Estero, and Villa Rio Bermejito, Chaco (Argentina). Six trees from each site were selected randomly. A wood disk from the main shaft of each individual, at a height of 1.3 m was achieved. The description of the wood and bark was performed. The relevant anatomical character with high diagnostic value was full stratification of radios. The rings are demarcated, with an average radial increment (RI) average 3.57 mm, the growth is slow-medium, with thick sapwood. The xylem has corresponding features to a mesomorphic species. The outer bark with one or two accumulated periderms, presents dehiscence in thin plates, which is a diagnostic element for field determination.",

        "abstract": "Mainstream feminism’ in India remained substantially elitist in its concerns carrying the legacy of ‘western feminism’. As such it failed to appreciate, accommodate and represent the specific concerns of Dalit women. Consequently Dalit women are forced to lead a separate movement. It is the premise of this paper that the nascent Dalit Feminism, which could not derive any theoretical and representational sustenance from the Indian Feminism, can draw from the African American womanist/feminist experiences as it shares a similar socio-historical environment. Further, it argues in favor of Dalit feminism as a more inclusive kind of feminism that challenges oppression of any form for women in India or elsewhere. As much of Dalit women’s writing is produced in Indian vernaculars a few short stories from Telugu Dalit writing, translated into English are analyzed to reflect different perspectives of Dalit women’s discourse.",

        "abstract": "Objective : In today’s scenario, the herbal medicines are much efficient for the treatment of various disorders as they have minimal side effects in comparison to the allopathic medicines. Bauhinia variegata L. (Mountain Ebony), commonly called Kachnar, belongs to the family Leguminosae. It is a medium-sized tree, mostly found at an altitude of 1300 m in the Himalayas. The objectives of the present study are to investigate various pharmacognostic, phytochemical analysis, and pharmacological properties of B. variegata. Methods : The powdered drug was used for estimating the loss on drying, ash values, fluorescence studies, chemical tests, and extractive values. Macroscopic and microscopic studies were also performed. Results : The leaf microscopy revealed the presence of upper and lower epidermis, palisade tissue, well-developed vascular bundle. The fluorescence characteristics of leaf powder were studied both in visible light and ultraviolet light (254 nm and 365 nm) after treatment with various reagents. Kachnar is composed of carbohydrates, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acid. It was reported that the total ash value was 8.15%. The acid insoluble ash value was 5.5%. Conclusion : The main pharmacological activities of B. variegata are anthelmintic, antiulcer, antitumor, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antigoitrogenic, and hepatoprotective. The present investigation provides the information on its pharmacognostic, phytochemical analysis, and pharmacological properties.

In this study, we explored how tree isolation or growing inside a fragment of remnant vegetation influence diversity of coleopterans in two plant species (Prosopis laevigata (Humb. &Bonpl.exWilld.) M.C. Johnst. (mesquite) and Ebenopsis ebano (Berl.) Barneby (Texas ebony). We found 72 coleopteran morphospecies; fifteen occurred mainly in remnant fragments and ten mainly in isolated trees. There were more insects under isolated mesquites than under those immersed in remnant fragments, while in Texas ebony the highest beetle density for isolated trees coincided with periods of bean and maize in surrounding agriculture.",

        "title": "Early Historic Material Culture in Karnataka with Particular Reference to Banavasi, North Kanara, India",
        "abstract": "In this paper I have tried to reconstruct the pattern of development at the early historic settlement of Banavasi, Karnataka. Karnataka has been broadly divided between forested Malnad and Maidan which is relatively more open and flat. The settlement of Banavasi lies in Malnad. Malnad has good drainage and enjoys cool climatic conditions. It is well-known for the cultivation of cash crops such as cashew, pepper, cardamom and cinnamon. Cool climate and heavy rains have resulted in a thick forest cover. Forests have given valuable products such as Teak, Ebony, Bamboo, Sandalwood, etc. Further, Malnad enjoys the benefit of having metals and minerals. The author has tried to explain that favourable climate and natural resources were the major factors responsible for rich habitation and over-all prosperity. This prosperity was manifested by rich archaeological assemblage that included structures, pottery, beads, terracottas, sculptures, coins, inscriptions, etc. The aim of this paper has been to have a comprehensive understanding of the socio-political and economic development and to contextualize it in relation to the local geographical setting. The main engagement has been with the basic issues concerning subsistence of the settlement, the early beginnings of social stratification and ruling authority and the contemporary religious beliefs. The principal concern of the author is to understand the patterns about human lifeways as indicated by the material remains of the period.",

        "abstract": "Aim: The objectives of this study was to measure the activity concentration of natural radionuclides in different drinking water sources in order to access the associated radiological health risk due to ingestion of such water. Study Design: The design of this study is purely experimental. Place and Duration: This study was carried out on drinking water sources around Uburu and Okposi salt lakes areas of Ebony state between April and September, 2016. Methodology: Sachet waters, borehole water, stream and river waters were collected and chemically treated by adding few drops of nitric acid to each of the samples and then preconcentrated and kept in a marinelli container for four weeks. The activity concentration of Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in all the water samples was measured using the HighPurity Germanium detector. Original Research Article Ononugbo and Nwaka; PSIJ, 15(3): 1-15, 2017; Article no.PSIJ.31625 2 Results: The specific activity concentration of Ra, 232Th and K ranged from BDL to 3.66± 0.78 Bql -1 , BDL to 7.56 ± 0.0.59 Bql -1 and BDL to 23.31 ± 1.65 Bql -1 respectively in sachet water. The activity concentration of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in borehole water ranges from BDL to 5.65±1.25, 0.45±0.09 to 13.00±0.97 and BDL to 26.45±1.83 Bql respectively. Furthermore the activity concentration of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in stream water ranges from BDL to 2.88±1.32 Bql -1 , BDL to 8.93±0.66 Bql and BDL to 33.32±2.18 Bql respectively, while that for river water ranges from 0.03±0.01 to 4.48±1.13 Bql -1 , 0.55±0.10 to 8.60±0.65Bql -1 and BDL to 13.85 ±0.98 Bql -1 respectively. The mean values of annual effective dose obtained for infants, children and adults are within the ICRP and WHO recommended reference values. The life-long cancer risk and hereditary effects due to ingestion of radionuclides by adults show that 16 out of 100,000 may suffer some form of cancer fatality and 9 out of 100,000 may suffer some hereditary effects. Statistical analysis of the data revealed a positively skewed and platokurtic distribution of radionuclides in all the drinking water sources. Conclusion: All the radiological health risk parameters obtained were within their safe values. Therefore, all the sampled drinking water are radiologically safe for domestic use but infant should not be given any of the studied drinking water since the annual total effective dose for infant exceeded the safe value.",

        "abstract": "As of all African-American literature, August Wilson's century cycle plays are of significance concerning African- American vernacular. After emancipation, the continued subordination of Blacks represented as an inferior race was justified by the denigration of central characteristics of Black identity such as language. The double-consciousness of the African-American, as mentioned by W.E. DuBois, has brought about differences not only in the social lives of the African-Americans but also in their use of the English language. Seven Guitars is a play in which the interactions between the characters and their language is particularly noticeable. Among the well-known scholars in the field of African-American Literature, Henry Louis Gates is celebrated for his in-depth research concerning African-American Literature, specifically its origins and ancestral connections. Gates posits that the African-American dialect has its roots in ancestral backgrounds. This paper aims to highlight the figuration of everyday language of African- Americans in Seven Guitars and the ways it brings out the personality of each character with emphasis on the work of Gates. It also brings forth the eminent role of ancestral roots and heritage underlying the lives of African- Americans.",

        "abstract": "Diospyros rumphii Bakh. is one of tropical commerciall wood species grouped in ebony. Ebony is the name of some species of commercial timber from genus of Diospyros (Ebenaceae). Seven species of them are commercial wood, which in the trade is known as ebony namely; D.celebica, D.rumphii, D.pilosanthera, D.lolin, D.ebenum, D.ferrea and D.macrophylla. Two of seven species ebony have the highest economic values namely; D.celebica and D.rumphii. Nowadays, the population D. rumphii in the nature are decreases due to over harvesting in the past. This study aims to determine genetic diversity of D. rumphii within populations, between populations and its relationship. The samples of D. rumphii in this study from four populations in North Sulawesi i.e Bitung, Talise, Talaud and Bolaang Mongondow. Genetic diversity was detected by isoenzym markers with seven enzyme i.e Glutamate oxaloacetate transmirase (GOT), Shikimate dehydrogenase (SHD), Esterase (EST), Acid phoshatase (ACP), Diaphorase (DIA), 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PG) and Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). The results showed that there are three enzym was detected polymorphisme i.e EST, GOT and GDH. Genetic diversity generated by three enzyme systems who are controlled by 5 loci and 15 alleles. The average percentage of polymorphic loci was100%. The number of total genetic diversity is 0.64,which are distributed within population 0.59 (91.24%) and between population 0.05(8.76%). Cluster analysis using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Aritmatic Means (UPGMA) based on Nei standard genetic distance showed three clusters:Bitung and Bolaang Mongondow, Talise, and Talaud.",

        "abstract": "Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based molecular techniques have been used to detect the polymorphism in plants. The utilization of molecular markers plays essential role in germplasm characterization and plant breeding since the information of DNA marker technology can be exchanged between laboratories and should have standard method to be reproducible. The molecular aspect has been commonly linked to DNA isolation protocol and polymorphic molecular marker, thus can be used for molecular research recommendation purposes. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the capability of microsatellite marker of Ebenaceae Family for amplifying Ebony DNA, and to determine the appropriate PCR annealing temperatures. The DNA isolation of Ebony leaves from Experimental Forest of Hasanuddin University Provenance was carried out using Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Plant) Geneaid protocol. Nine of seventeen selected primers from the Genus Diospyros were able to amplify Ebony DNA. Amplification products produced polymorphic bands with different annealing temperatures (ranged from 53 to 56°C). These nine polymorphic primers will be recommended to use for future studies in genetic diversity as well as pollen dispersal pattern analyses.",

        "title": "Things Fall Apart and Dadi Budha: Portrayal of indigenous community and their disintegration",
        "abstract": "In Gopinath Mohanty’s Dadi budha (1944) which was translated in the name “The Ancestor” and in Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” (1958), both the authors recreate in fictional modes, the indigenous life of the people of two primitive cultures, living on the hills of Koraput, India and in the forests of Nigeria, respectively. This comparison was first drawn by the son of the author Gopinath Mohanty, Arun Kumar Mohanty, who translated Dadi Budha in English. In the afterward of his translation he made this observation and also countered a very important problem of comparison – the problem of language. While “Things Fall Apart” is written in English by an African author, for whom English is just a medium of expression and not a vernacular language; Dadi Budha has been translated into English. Arun Kumar Mohanty vindicates this problem of language by arguing that most original works in English by non-English writers can be viewed as works of self-translation. To back his decision up, he referred to Joanne Akai’s paper on West Indian writing as translation:\n“Constantly writing in and for another culture, WI writers operate in a space between cultural and linguistic traditions: between Caribbean Creole culture and British or North American English culture, between the Creole language and the English language, between an oral genre (storytelling) and a written genre (novel or short story). WI writers are therefore faced with a number of challenges: as Translators, they must master the language they write-translate to from, as well as the language they write-translate into; as ambassadors, they must accurately represent Carribean experience and reality, as writers, they must communicate in a language that is accessible to as wide an audience as possible.”",

        "title": "Efficient Screening of CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Events in Drosophila Using a Co-CRISPR Strategy",
        "abstract": "Genome editing using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and associated nuclease (Cas9) enables specific genetic modifications, including deletions, insertions, and substitutions in numerous organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. One challenge of the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be the laborious and time-consuming screening required to find CRISPR-induced modifications due to a lack of an obvious phenotype and low frequency after editing. Here we apply the successful co-CRISPR technique in Drosophila to simultaneously target a gene of interest and a marker gene, ebony, which is a recessive gene that produces dark body color and has the further advantage of not being a commonly used transgenic marker. We found that Drosophila broods containing higher numbers of CRISPR-induced ebony mutations (“jackpot” lines) are significantly enriched for indel events in a separate gene of interest, while broods with few or no ebony offspring showed few mutations in the gene of interest. Using two different PAM sites in our gene of interest, we report that ∼61% (52–70%) of flies from the ebony-enriched broods had an indel in DNA near either PAM site. Furthermore, this marker mutation system may be useful in detecting the less frequent homology-directed repair events, all of which occurred in the ebony-enriched broods. By focusing on the broods with a significant number of ebony flies, successful identification of CRISPR-induced events is much faster and more efficient. The co-CRISPR technique we present significantly improves the screening efficiency in identification of genome-editing events in Drosophila.",

        "title": "Identification and temporal expression of putative circadian clock transcripts in the amphipod crustacean Talitrus saltator",
        "abstract": "Background Talitrus saltator is an amphipod crustacean that inhabits the supralittoral zone on sandy beaches in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. T. saltator exhibits endogenous locomotor activity rhythms and time-compensated sun and moon orientation, both of which necessitate at least one chronometric mechanism. Whilst their behaviour is well studied, currently there are no descriptions of the underlying molecular components of a biological clock in this animal, and very few in other crustacean species. Methods We harvested brain tissue from animals expressing robust circadian activity rhythms and used homology cloning and Illumina RNAseq approaches to sequence and identify the core circadian clock and clock-related genes in these samples. We assessed the temporal expression of these genes in time-course samples from rhythmic animals using RNAseq. Results We identified a comprehensive suite of circadian clock gene homologues in T. saltator including the ‘core’ clock genes period (Talper), cryptochrome 2 (Talcry2), timeless (Taltim), clock (Talclk), and bmal1 (Talbmal1). In addition we describe the sequence and putative structures of 23 clock-associated genes including two unusual, extended isoforms of pigment dispersing hormone (Talpdh). We examined time-course RNAseq expression data, derived from tissues harvested from behaviourally rhythmic animals, to reveal rhythmic expression of these genes with approximately circadian period in Talper and Talbmal1. Of the clock-related genes, casein kinase IIβ (TalckIIβ), ebony (Talebony), jetlag (Taljetlag), pigment dispensing hormone (Talpdh), protein phosphatase 1 (Talpp1), shaggy (Talshaggy), sirt1 (Talsirt1), sirt7 (Talsirt7) and supernumerary limbs (Talslimb) show temporal changes in expression. Discussion We report the sequences of principle genes that comprise the circadian clock of T. saltator and highlight the conserved structural and functional domains of their deduced cognate proteins. Our sequencing data contribute to the growing inventory of described comparative clocks. Expression profiling of the identified clock genes illuminates tantalising targets for experimental manipulation to elucidate the molecular and cellular control of clock-driven phenotypes in this crustacean.",

The analysis of this research focused on the words used such as African American Vernacular English variety, Informal language and American slang in the lyrics of the song Love The Way You Lie Part II and explain them. The result findings showed that there was a transcultural process or cross cultural in the song lyrics. There was a hiphop culture which was moved, changed and reused to create a new identity of the Eminem.

        "title": "Nature and Management of Some Marine Ecosystems in Vietnam: A Case Study at The Hon Mun Island at Nha Trang",
        "abstract": "Nha Trang is a city in Vietnam endowed with several sceneries which has attracted several tourists around the world over the past few decades. The city is highly characterized by coastal features as well as beautiful landscapes. Among these features are; beaches, caves with swift-let birds, resort centers, islands, traditional temples, forts and so on. The act of enhancing economic activities, coupled with some natural factors like; climate change as well as the increasing number of tourists’ over the years has led to the alteration of some of these ecosystems, that gives the city its value, hence, sense of attracting numerous tourists from all walks of life. The Hon Mun Islands are located to the south of Nha Trang Bay. Hon Mun MPA is situated in central - South Vietnam, offshore from the coastal resort city of Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa Province. The name “Hon Mun” (means Black Island) comes from the high and rugged cliffs forming up caves, particularly black rock here as ebony, very rarely seen elsewhere. Due to the island’s location adjacent to the hot sea-currents from the equator, suitable to the development conditions of corals and various types of tropical sea creatures, the sea bed of Hon Mun is home to an abundant and diverse group of marine species, an interesting and useful place for researchers, oceanographers and tourists to observe and explore more of the sea creatures’ life [1]. It is for these reasons why this study was conducted to delve into the nature, management and threats posed on the ecosystems at the Hon Mun Island at Nha Trang in Vietnam.",

        "abstract": "Brushwood species have been spurned traditionally, their use being limited to the production of fences, firewood and charcoal. This paper presents research results on the microscopical anatomy and physical-mechanical properties of four brushwood species typically found in Northeastern Mexico, with the purpose of expanding the possibility of their commercial use. The species are barreta (Helietta parvifolia (Gray ex Hemsl.) Benth), canelon (Melia azedarach L.), ebony (Ebenopsis ebano (Berl.) Barneby & Grimes), and tenaza (Havardia pallens (Benth.) Britt. & Rose). The physical-mechanical properties determined are density, percentage of shrinkage and swelling, modulus of elasticity, and flexural strength. Test results for baretta prove that its wood is heavy, hard, easy to dry, and flexible with little shrinkage during the drying process. Canelon (also known as chinaberry or umbrella tree) is characterized by having a higher density compared to other species. This wood has wide annual growth rings, being easy to dry and work with, and resistant to insect attack. Ebony exhibits a heavy wood that it is only possible to work while green or through special machinery when dry. Ebony's heartwood has a low susceptibility to insect infestations. Shrinkage is similar to that of pine wood (sometimes slightly lower), it is easy to dry, very flexible when wet, however not very resistant to insect infestations.",

        "abstract": "This paper used the Discursive Approach to Language and Gender studies to examine all-female linguistic choices and how linguistic variation amongst female interlocutors is a representation of each female’s individual and cultural identity and feminist ideology. The study revealed that linguistic variability abounds between individual women as well as amongst women as a social group and further showed that each individual woman’s talk-style reflects her linguistic idiolect and translates to her individual feminist ideology. The study also showed that the interactional style of Black American women and the use of their peculiar Black vernacular English called Ebonics identify them as a separate socio-cultural group with a separate feminist ideology different from that of their white counterparts. The study concluded that individual women’s linguistic choices and socio-cultural background militates against a universal feminist ideology but rather makes feminism multicultural / pluralist in theory and practice.

In addition, these domains are also heterogeneous, e.g., with respect to registers and dialects. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a POS tagger for subtitles, lyrics, and tweets associated with African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). We learn from a mixture of randomly sampled and manually annotated Twitter data and unlabeled data, which we automatically and partially label using mined tag dictionaries. Our POS tagger obtains a tagging accuracy of 89% on subtitles, 85% on lyrics, and 83% on tweets, with up to 55% error reductions over a state-of-the-art newswire POS tagger, and 15-25% error reductions over a state-of-the-art Twitter POS tagger.",

        "abstract": "Although most models suggest continental Antarctica was covered by ice during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) it has been speculated that endemic species of soil invertebrates could have survived the Pleistocene at high elevation habitats protruding above the ice sheets. We analyzed a series of soil samples from different elevations at three locations along the Beardmore Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains (in order of increasing elevation): Ebony Ridge (ER), Cloudmaker (CM), and Meyer Desert (MD). Geochemical analyses show the MD soils, which were exposed during the LGM, were the least weathered compared to lower elevations, and also had the highest total dissolved solids (TDS). MD soils are dominated by nitrate salts (NO3/Cl ratios >10) that can be observed in SEM images. High δ17O and δ18O values of the nitrate indicate that its source is solely of atmospheric origin. It is suggested that nitrate concentrations in the soil may be utilized to determine a relative “wetting age” to better assess invertebrate habitat suitability. The highest elevation sites at MD have been exposed and accumulating salts for the longest times, and because of the salt accumulations, they were not suitable as invertebrate refugia during the LGM.",

        "abstract": "Crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), a member of the family Lythraceae, originated in China and historical records of its cultivation in the country date back to 1700 years ago, well before its cultivation in other areas in the world (Zhang, 1991). Known for its longlasting flowers in midsummer, wide range of flower colors (white, red, purple, pink, and their combined variants), extensive diversity of growth habits (miniature shrub to large tree), and appealing barks (cinnamon colored to gray colored), L. indica is a key parent for crape myrtle breeding (Cabrera, 2002). Many crape myrtle cultivars are now widely used in Chinese landscaping (Min et al., 2008). In the past 50 years, most breeding efforts have focused on resistance to diseases and in combinations with other desirable horticultural traits (Pooler, 2006; Pooler and Dix, 1999). Many cultivars are available in a broad range of growth habits to service various landscape objectives (Egolf, 1986, 1990; Knox, 2000). In recent years, five dark leaf crape myrtle cultivars (e.g., Ebony Embers, EbonyFire, EbonyFlame,EbonyGlow, and Ebony and Ivory) have been bred (Pounders et al., 2013). Although a large number of new crape myrtle cultivars have been released through breeding and selection efforts since the 1960s, no yellow leaf crape myrtle cultivars are available. Here, we report a new yellow leaf crape myrtle cultivar named as Jinhuang. Origin",

        "title": "Modélisation des isothermes de sorption, caractérisation des propriétés thermodynamiques et détermination des humidités d’équilibre d’usage des bois tropicaux",
        "abstract": "Les bois tropicaux sont largement produits dans le bassin du Congo et en Amazonie et leurs exportations sont source de beaucoup d’argent. Il est important de réduire les pertes suite à une utilisation d’un bon processus de séchage lié aux conditions de l’environnement (température et humidité relative de l’air). Dans ce travail, nous modélisons les isothermes de sorption de six bois tropicaux (Sapele, Afzelia, Obeche, Ebony, Frake et Moabi) en utilisant onze modèles, les points expérimentaux sont prix dans la littérature avec la température de l’air comprise entre 15 et 60°C et l’humidité relative de l’air comprise entre 0.02 et 0.98 %. Selon les valeurs moyennes des erreurs obtenues, les modèles de GAB, Luikov modifié et de Nelson sont les meilleurs modèles recommandés pour traduire les isothermes de sorption des bois tropicaux. Les mauvais modèles sont les modèles d’Halsey modifié, Smith modifié, GAB modifié et le modèle d’Iglesias, Chirife et Halsey. Les modèles qui donnent une description assez satisfaisante sont ceux de Henderson modifié, Oswin modifié et Chung et Pfost modifié. Le modèle de BET est approprié pour estimer la teneur en eau d’équilibre lorsque la monocouche est saturée. Les valeurs des énergies d’activation obtenues sont rangées entre 8420 et 13911 J/mol lors de la désorption et entre 3266 et 6499 J/mol lors de l’adsorption. Les points de saturation des fibres (PSF) et les énergies libres de Gibbs par gramme d’eau adsorbée obtenus décroisent lorsqu’augmente la température à une humidité relative de l’air donnée. Les PSF obtenus sont confinés entre 0.16 et 0.33 kg/kg. Les valeurs moyennes des énergies libres de Gibbs par gramme d’eau absorbée varient de 149 à 206 cal/g. la différence des enthalpies molaires de sorption entre les monocouches et les multicouches au-delà de la saturation de la monocouche est en général supérieure de la différence entre les enthalpies molaires de sorption des multicouches au-delà de la saturation de la monocouche et l’eau à l’état liquide. La teneur en eau d’équilibre au niveau de la saturation de la monocouche est située entre 0.025 et 0.08 kg/kg. A de faibles teneurs en eau, la chaleur isostérique de sorption des bois étudiés est importante et décroît avec une convergence vers 1760 kJ/kg à 40°C lorsqu’augmente la teneur en eau d’équilibre. La température influence la chaleur isostérique de sorption des bois tropicaux étudiés. Les humidités des planches recherchées durant leur séchage sont fonction du milieu d’utilisation (ville, intérieur, extérieur, intérieur conditionné). Ces valeurs sont présentées dans la dernière partie de ce papier.",

        "title": "Exploring Salient Socio-Linguistic Features of African-American English Vernacular",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to highlight the distinguishing socio-linguistic features of African-American English Vernacular. It focused on this variety in terms of different theories concerning its origin and provided a relatively detailed description of the structure of this dialect. Furthermore, the study attempted to discuss the most common educational controversies surrounding the use of this particular variety of English as it is used in America today. Related literature was first reviewed especially that which is directly related to various theories concerning the origin of African-American English Vernacular and how this dialect has developed as a major dialect of American English over time in the United States. Empirically, the data collection process involved eliciting spoken data in naturally occurring circumstances from African-American informants residing in the state of Texas in 2014. The study included twenty male and female informants enrolled at Texas A & M University, College Station in both graduate and undergraduate programs. The researchers used both personal and telephone interviews in the data collection process after obtaining the personal written consent of the informants in both cases. The data were then carefully reviewed and analyzed in an attempt to determine the most salient grammatical, phonological, lexical, and social features of AAEV as it is used in America today. Although a strong correlation between AAEV and Standard American English (SAE) exists, AAEV’s unique origins remain unknown. AAEV is similar to Creole language forms used by many the world over. Phonology traits that differentiate AAEV from other language forms include: Word-final devoicing, reduction of certain diphthong forms to monophthongs . AAEV’s vocabulary is similar to that of Southern informal American dialects. In fact, AAEV users are typically bi-dialectal, meaning that they code-switch between AAEV and SAE often. Debates over AAEV’s use have formed controversial socio-cultural settings with regard to education, particularly that of African-American youth. For example, the Resolution of Oakland held that AAEV had little to do with SAE or any other European language but rather originated from West-African languages. Despite all the controversies surrounding AAEV in terms of its origin or educational role in America today, it might be safe to propose that this particular dialect of American English-call it what you wish-will only receive more attention in modern linguistics and acquire gradual socio-linguistic prestige in the 21 st century. This assumption is primarily based on the overwhelming political changes in the United States today.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzed K-pop song texts in terms of language hybridization. The findings show that language hybridization proceeds in two ways: incorporating different varieties of English and code-switches between Korean and English. Different English varieties such as standard colloquial English, African American Vernacular English, and Koreanized English are used in K-pop song texts. Also, code-switches are the significant mode of language use in all the K-pop song texts analyzed for the research. K-pop lyrical texts maximize Korean and English bilingual resources to appeal not only to the local Korean audience but to the global fans. In the language hybridization processes, English varieties and Korean/English code-switches are utilized as effective resources in striking a balance between the locality and the globality of the K-pop songs.

        "abstract": "The Nilotic Meroitic state, in what is now the Sudan, existed from the late fourth century BC until the mid fourth century AD. It has come to be regarded in recent years as an African segmentary state with a prestige-goods economy, less centralised than, for example, Egypt, with direct control by the ruling family diminished outside the Shendi Reach (central Sudan). Outbound trade from its capital Meroe included ebony, elephants, gold, iron, ivory and ostrich feathers. Trade routes criss-crossed the desert and extended down the Nile river to Greco-Roman Egypt, as well as through Red Sea ports to several Middle Eastern destinations including Egypt. Using the southern and southeastern reaches of the Meroitic state as a case study, I argue that to conceptualise the frontier peripheries of early states as borders is to misunderstand their internal dynamics (movements of people, fluid social networks and regional exchange systems). Each region had its own distinctive form of power relations. Examining how communities in these frontier zones were constituted, inscribed their identities in the landscape and facilitated trade in relation to the core of the Meroitic state in the Shendi Reach draws attention to the fluidity and continual renegotiation of state–pastoral relations.",

        "abstract": "Butterflies are exceptionally diverse but their potential as an experimental system has been limited by the difficulty of deciphering heterozygous genomes and a lack of genetic manipulation technology. Here we use a hybrid assembly approach to construct high-quality reference genomes for Papilio xuthus (contig and scaffold N50: 492 kb, 3.4 Mb) and Papilio machaon (contig and scaffold N50: 81 kb, 1.15 Mb), highly heterozygous species that differ in host plant affiliations, and adult and larval colour patterns. Integrating comparative genomics and analyses of gene expression yields multiple insights into butterfly evolution, including potential roles of specific genes in recent diversification. To functionally test gene function, we develop an efficient (up to 92.5%) CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method that yields obvious phenotypes with three genes, Abdominal-B, ebony and frizzled. Our results provide valuable genomic and technological resources for butterflies and unlock their potential as a genetic model system. Butterflies are a promising system to study the genetics and evolution of morphological diversification, yet genomic and technological resources are limited. Here, the authors sequence genomes of two Papiliobutterflies and develop a CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method for these species.",

        "abstract": "The determination of work index of Enyigba Lead Ore, Ebony State using the modified bond energy (Berry & Bruce) method was investigated. The test sample was obtained from Enyigba village in Ebonyi State. A reference material (granite) was sourced from Anguwan-Boro granite deposit, Sabo, Kaduna metropolis. A known weight of reference and test material were crushed, pulverized and ground using the laboratory ball mill machine. The cell used in grinding the two samples has twelve steel balls of diameter 3.5cm and 222g weight. The size analysis of the feed for both reference and test material was found to be 218.2 and 218.6µm, and a ball mill discharge was 189.9 and 188.9µm respectively. The granite as a reference material with work index of 15.13kwh/ short ton was used to calculate the work index of the test material which was found to be 14.37kwh/short ton, being the energy required to comminute one tone of the ore and confirmed to be within the range indicated by previous research work on lead ore.",

        "abstract": "Dialect features typically do not make it into formal writing, but flourish in social media. This enables largescale variational studies. We focus on three phonological features of African American Vernacular English and their manifestation as spelling variations on Twitter. We discuss to what extent our data can be used to falsify eight sociolinguistic hypotheses. To go beyond the spelling level, we require automatic analysis such as POS tagging, but social media language still challenges language technologies. We show how both newswire- and Twitter-adapted stateof-the-art POS taggers perform significantly worse on AAVE tweets, suggesting that large-scale dialect studies of language variation beyond the surface level are not feasible with out-ofthe-box NLP tools.",

        "abstract": "The modification of transcriptional regulation has become increasingly appreciated as a major contributor to morphological evolution. However, the role of negative-acting control elements (e.g. silencers) in generating morphological diversity has been generally overlooked relative to positive-acting “enhancer” elements. The highly variable body coloration patterns among Drosophilid insects represents a powerful model system in which the molecular alterations that underlie phenotypic diversity can be defined. In a survey of pigment phenotypes among geographically disparate Japanese populations of Drosophila auraria, we discovered a remarkable degree of variation in male-specific abdominal coloration. In testing the expression patterns of the major pigment-producing enzymes, we found that phenotypes uniquely correlated with differences in the expression of ebony, a gene required for yellow-colored cuticle. Assays of ebony’s transcriptional control region indicated that a lightly pigmented strain harbored cis-regulatory mutations that caused correlated changes in its expression. Through a series of chimeric reporter constructs between light and dark strain alleles, we localized function-altering mutations to a conserved silencer that mediates a male-specific pattern of ebony repression. This suggests that the light allele was derived through the loss of this silencer’s activity. Furthermore, examination of the ebony gene of D. serrata, a close relative of D. auraria which secondarily lost male-specific pigmentation revealed the parallel loss of this silencer element. These results demonstrate how loss-of-function mutations in a silencer element resulted in increased gene expression. We propose that the mutational inactivation of silencer elements may represent a favored path to evolve gene expression, impacting morphological traits.",

        "abstract": "Pigmentation varies within and between species and is often adaptive. The amount of pigmentation on the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster is a relatively simple morphological trait, which serves as a model for mapping the genetic basis of variation in complex phenotypes. Here, we assessed natural variation in female abdominal pigmentation in 175 sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel, derived from the Raleigh, NC population. We quantified the proportion of melanization on the two most posterior abdominal segments, tergites 5 and 6 (T5, T6). We found significant genetic variation in the proportion of melanization and high broad-sense heritabilities for each tergite. Genome-wide association studies identified over 150 DNA variants associated with the proportion of melanization on T5 (84), T6 (34), and the difference between T5 and T6 (35). Several of the top variants associated with variation in pigmentation are in tan, ebony, and bric-a-brac1, genes known to affect D. melanogaster abdominal pigmentation. Mutational analyses and targeted RNAi-knockdown showed that 17 out of 28 (61%) novel candidate genes implicated by the genome-wide association study affected abdominal pigmentation. Several of these genes are involved in developmental and regulatory pathways, chitin production, cuticle structure, and vesicle formation and transport. These findings show that genetic variation may affect multiple steps in pathways involved in tergite development and melanization. Variation in these novel candidates may serve as targets for adaptive evolution and sexual selection in D. melanogaster.",

        "abstract": "There are only a few discussions about Papua’s trading in ancient history era in the context of Nusantara. This article describes the trading and its commodities in Papua, started from a foreign source about Srivijaya c. 8th century AD. Commodities from Papua became more well-known since Java’s involvement in the distribution process through “entrepot” gate Seram Sea and Banda. Majapahit 14th century’s records mentioned Onim as one of the important places in Papua. This paper describes the exported and imported commodities and some sites which indicated important coastal places during the dynamic of trading in historic Papua from 14th century AD onwards. From 14th to 20th century AD, beside beautiful birds, ebony and slaves, Papua also exported nutmegs, masohi ( cinamomum sp. ) timbers, sandalwoods, ambers, turtle shell, shark fins, pearl shells and sea cucumbers. Some commodities were also being exported later on in 20th century AD such as crocodile skins, rattan and copra. In the other hand, Papua imported many things like beads, ceramics, Timor cloth, iron tools, foods and weapons.",

However, I really didn’t fit the stereotype.  I had been involved with several organizations that explicitly addressed issues of race and education for several years, often as the only white person there.  I was thrilled to be placed at a school such as Prescott, whose reputation for high achievement for African American children and adoption of the “Ebonics” program had placed it at the forefront of national debate.",

        "abstract": "When females mate to multiple males, the last male to mate fathers the majority of progeny. When males of different species inseminate a female, the sperm of the male conspecific to the female is favored in fertilization in a process known as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP). A large number of studies in Drosophila have assayed the genetic basis of sperm competition, with a main focus on D. melanogaster and accessory gland protein genes. Only a few studies have attempted to disentangle the genetic basis of CSP between related species of Drosophila. Although there is no a priori reason to believe that genes influencing intraspecific sperm competitive ability might also mediate conspecific sperm precedence, no study has addressed the question. Here, we test a group of candidate CSP genes between D. simulans and D. mauritiana for their effect on sperm competition in D. melanogaster. The use of P-element insertion lines identified CG14891 gene disruption as the only one causing a significant decrease in second male paternity success relative to wild-type and ebony tester males. The gene disruption affected both sperm displacement and the sperm fertilizing ability. Out of five genes tested using RNA interference, only gene knockdown of CG6864 (Mst89B) significantly reduced the male’s ability to father progeny when second to mate. Our results suggest that CG14891 and CG6864 might have been co-opted from an intraspecies gene function (i.e., sperm competition) into an interspecies avoidance phenotype (i.e., CSP). Alternatively, the dual role of these genes could be a consequence of their pleiotropic roles.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of environmental RNA interference (RNAi), in which gene expression is suppressed via feeding with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, opened the door to the practical application of RNAi-based techniques in crop pest management. The western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) is one of the most devastating corn pests in North America. Interestingly, WCR displays a robust environmental RNAi response, raising the possibility of applying an RNAi-based pest management strategy to this pest. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the WCR environmental RNAi process will allow for determining the rate limiting steps involved with dsRNA toxicity and potential dsRNA resistance mechanisms in WCR. In this study, we have established a two-step in vivo assay system, which allows us to evaluate the involvement of genes in environmental RNAi in WCR. We show that laccase 2 and ebony, critical cuticle pigmentation/tanning genes, can be used as marker genes in our assay system, with ebony being a more stable marker to monitor RNAi activity. In addition, we optimized the dsRNA dose and length for the assay, and confirmed that this assay system is sensitive to detect well-known RNAi components such as Dicer-2 and Argonaute-2. We also evaluated two WCR sid1- like (sil) genes with this assay system. This system will be useful to quickly survey candidate systemic RNAi genes in WCR, and also will be adaptable for a genome-wide RNAi screening to give us an unbiased view of the environmental/systemic RNAi pathway in WCR.",

        "abstract": "Summary \n \nThis study presents data on inheritance of a darkened caudal peduncle (ebony) and yellow body coloration (yellow) in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Fifteen progeny groups, obtained by crossing fish with three color phenotypes and of known origin, were analyzed. Analyzes of segregation in F1 progeny involving groups from parental crosses of wild-type colored × wild-type colored; ebony × ebony; yellow × yellow, showed that the parents produced the offspring only with the same phenotypes (true breeding). Crosses involving F1 wild-type colored parents (that resulted from crosses of wild-type parents with either ebony or yellow fish) showed in their F2 progeny groups of which their phenotypic segregations did not differ significantly from a 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio. The progeny of back-cross of ebony × (F1 wild-type colored × ebony) showed phenotypic segregations that did not differ significantly from the 1 : 1 Mendelian ratio. Overall, the results of the crossing experiments demonstrated that, similar to albinism described in a number of aquacultured species, ebony and yellow body coloration in S. aurata are both due to a single recessive allele. However, the yellow mutation of a gene controlling yellow pigment synthesis affects the yellow color of the whole fish body, whereas the ebony mutation causes production of melanin only in a specific area of the fish body, resulting in the development of a black coloration of the caudal peduncle. Experiments to assess culture performance showed that the color genes controlling ebony and yellow coloration had significant detrimental pleiotropic effects on growth, survival and body shape. Color mutations in the gilthead sea bream may be used as models for the study of: (i) genetic and physiological mechanisms of sterility, (ii) stress and disease resistance, (iii) effects of heterosis, (iv) genetic polymorphism in populations, and (v) methods of genetic protection in selected sea bream strains as well as in experiments on chromosome set manipulation.",

        "title": "Sex, butterflies and molecular biology: when pigmentation met mimicry",
        "abstract": "Pigmentation, specifically melanism, is often the driving force behind classic examples of natural selection such as camouflage and mimicry. However, whilst pigmentation in insects has long been considered the exclusive preserve of the genetic model Drosophila, stunning new papers on the molecular basis of melanism and mimicry in butterflies are beginning to show how evolution can act directly on what has previously been viewed as strictly a developmental problem. For example, pigmentation and mimicry in the striking yellow, black and red ‘Postman’ butterflies of the genus Heliconius is controlled by transcription factors, such as optix, apparently redeployed from their roles in early development. Melanism is also important in sexual dimorphism and within butterflies is often used to generate mimicry-related sex-limited polymorphisms. Whilst a number of different butterfly families show such sex-limited mimicry, the swallowtail butterflies of the genus Papilio form an excellent model in which to study the genetics of pigmentation under strong natural selection. Clarke and Sheppard used swallowtails to study the genetics of mimicry and were the first to come up with the concept of a ‘supergene’, inferred to be a block of tightly linked genes somehow acting together to account for the seemingly complex array of different pigmentation phenotypes they observed in their genetic crosses. \n \nKunte et al. have now used a blistering series of genetic crosses, association mapping, transcriptome and genome sequencing to look at sex-limited melanism and mimicry in the Asian swallowtail Papilio polytes, which appears to be controlled by onesuch ‘supergene’. Here, males are black and yellow and are monomorphic and non-mimetic, whereas the females are either male like or belong to one of several different melanic morphs mimicking distasteful species from a different swallowtail genus, Pachliopta. Clarke and Sheppard had already shown that this female polymorphism, including the presence or absence of the swallow ‘tails’ themselves, was under the control of a single Mendelian locus or ‘supergene’. They envisaged that a tightly linked cluster of genes, each controlling different aspects of wing pattern, must be behaving as one single locus and that recombination within this supergene cluster would be unexpected or rare. Some 40 years later, Kunte and co-workers have confirmed that polymorphism is controlled by one single gene, doublesex, rather than a cluster of tightly linked loci. This helps explain why autosomal loci, such as the H locus that controls female-limited mimicry in P. dardanus, can be expressed in a sex-‘limited’ fashion rather than specifically being sex-linked as in the W (female specific chromosome)-linked, female-limited melanism in P. glaucus. This is of course because doublesex is responsible for somatic sex determination rather than the germline determined sex of the butterfly itself. Unfortunately, like any good piece of research, however, it also raises perhaps more questions than it answers. For example, Drosophila doublesex uses alternative splicing to control somatic sex differentiation, one splice form leading to male sexual differentiation and the other to female. But surprisingly, cloning of doublesex isoforms from mimetic and non-mimetic P. polytes males and females suggests no specific presence–absence correlation of isoforms with mimicry, rather gene expression levels themselves seem to be more important. \n \nThese findings highlight the huge gap now exposed between these regulatory ‘switch’ genes (doublesex, optix and WntA) and the genes controlling pigmentation itself. In swallowtails, yellow colour is formed by a pigment called papiliochrome and black is formed by melanin. In a strange twist, the precursor dopamine is required both to form the yellow papiliochrome (after its transformation to N-β-alanyl dopamine by N-β-alanyl dopamine synthase, the product of the ebony locus) and melanin itself (via dopamine quinone). To provide dopamine to the correct set of scales (yellow or black) at the correct stage in development, transcription of the dopa decarboxylase (DDC) encoding gene (which converts dihydroxy-phenylananine to dopamine) is therefore switched from the yellow pattern early in wing pigmentation to the black pattern just prior to butterfly eclosion (Koch et al., 1998). Such an exquisite spatial and temporal regulation of the enzymes involved in pigmentation is also mimicked by a similar regulation in which the scale cells themselves develop. In essence, therefore, pigmentation of the butterfly wing involves differential rates of development of differently coloured scales, in a process similar to developmental ‘heterochrony’. To become coloured (yellow or white), the scales must develop ‘early’, to be pigmented in the ‘papiliochrome window’, and in order to be black, they must delay their development to be exposed to the correct availability of melanin precursors (ffrench-Constant and Koch, 2003). So what has this all to do with doublesex and the control of somatic sex differentiation? Further what are the missing players in between the switch gene doublesex and the pigmentation gene ddc? \n \nThe final pigmentation of butterfly wings in the pupa, just before hatching, is set against a falling titre of the hatching hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, and specific ecdysone receptor isoforms show colour pattern-specific expression during wing pattern development (Koch et al., 2003). The development of scale cells that are destined to be different colours must therefore be differentially triggered across the maturing butterfly wing, but again what is the critical trigger for the initiation of scale cell development itself? In this context, it is hard to understand how doublesex, a gene previously thought to be important in somatic sex determination, can also be deployed as a patterning gene. Thus, the doublesex switch not only appears to be involved in the genetic control of female morphs, but expression of the doublesex protein in developing scale cells also correlates with the yellowish white rays found on the forewing of mimetic females. Loehlin and Carroll, in their accompanying commentary in the same issue of Nature on pages 172–173 note that rather than simply indicating whether a specific tissue is male or female, doublesex expression is also elaborately regulated itself and shows tissue-specific expression in its own right. This means that doublesex is not only the female-limited switch gene but also a wing patterning gene. \n \n \nFinally, if a tightly linked cluster of genes (a supergene) is indeed only one albeit rather complicated gene, what exactly is recombination within a supergene? Loehlin and Carroll already noted that complex genes like doublesex probably carry a significant number of regulatory elements themselves and that any ‘recombinants’ within this supergene (although none have been noted for P. polytes by either Clarke and Sheppard or indeed Kunte et al.), or others, may be recombination events between different doublesex enhancers, that is, specifically correspond to recombinants within one gene rather than a set of clustered genes. Further, Kunte et al. also found an inversion polymorphism with breakpoints flanking the doublesex gene; however, it is not clear how different inversions might lock together different doublesex regulatory elements to drive different patterns of scale cell development. These results are similar to inversions around the P locus of Heliconius numata, which control the wide range of mimetic morphs associated with Mullerian mimicry (Joron et al., 2011). \n \n‘a tightly linked cluster of genes (a supergene) is indeed only one, albeit rather complicated, gene’ \n \nSignificantly, many of these melanic mimicry examples, including P. polytes and H. numata, show dominance series amongst the different mimetic alleles with more melanic morphs being dominant over paler ones. If we now understand these to be alleles of a single gene (doublesex or P), then it may be easier to understand how such dominance series have evolved. Different inversions may therefore simply ‘lock together’ different enhancer elements and thus drive morph specific patterns of expression from different alleles of a single switch gene. This may also help to explain the famous ‘industrial’ melanism of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, where again darker forms are dominant over lighter ones and again melanism looks to be under control of a single locus at the equivalent chromosomal location to H. numata P (Van't Hof et al., 2011). This very brief review of pigmentation and melanism in butterflies and moths therefore gives us two important ‘take-home messages’. First, pigmentation is about more than just ‘development’ and can in fact act as a major driver of natural selection. Second, and as a direct correlate to this, understanding the developmental heterochrony that underlies insect pigmentation is critical to our understanding of the molecular basis of natural selection itself.",

        "abstract": "The Drosophila homolog of schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin (Ddysb) affects a range of behaviors through regulation of multiple neurotransmitter signals, including dopamine activity. To gain insights into mechanisms underlying Ddysb-dependent regulation of dopamine signal, we investigated interaction between Ddysb and Ebony, the Drosophila β-alanyl-monoamine synthase involved in dopamine recycling. We found that Ddysb was capable of regulating expression of Ebony in a bi-directional manner and its subcellular distribution. Such regulation is confined to glial cells. The expression level of ebony and its accumulation in glial soma depend positively on Ddysb activity, whereas its distribution in glial processes is bound to be reduced in response to any alterations of Ddysb from the normal control level, either an increase or decrease. An optimal binding ratio between Dysb and Ebony might contribute to such non-linear effects. Thus, Ddysb-dependent regulation of Ebony could be one of the mechanisms that mediate dopamine signal.",

        "abstract": "Most hymenopteran species exhibit conspicuous sexual dimorphism due to ecological differences between the sexes. As hymenopteran genomes, under the haplodiploid genetic system, exhibit quantitative differences between sexes while remaining qualitatively identical, sexual phenotypes are assumed to be expressed through sex-specific gene usage. In the present study, the molecular basis for expression of sexual dimorphism in a queenless ant, Diacamma sp., which exhibits a distinct color dimorphism, was examined. Worker females of the species appear bluish-black, while winged males exhibit a yellowish-brown body color. Initially, observations of the pigmentation processes during pupal development revealed that black pigmentation was present in female pupae but not in males, suggesting that sex-specific melanin synthesis was responsible for the observed color dimorphism. Therefore, five orthologs of the genes involved in the insect melanin synthesis (yellow, ebony, tan, pale and dopa decarboxylase) were subcloned and their spatiotemporal expression patterns were examined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Of the genes examined, yellow, which plays a role in black melanin synthesis in insects, was expressed at higher levels in females than in males throughout the entire body during the pupal stage. RNA interference of yellow was then carried out in order to determine the gene function, and produced females with a more yellowish, brighter body color similar to that of males. It was concluded that transcriptional regulation of yellow was responsible for the sexual color dimorphism observed in this species.",

        "abstract": "\n Using county-level voting data from the 2008 presidential election in New York State, we find evidence that durable cultural factors influence voting behavior. After controlling for contemporaneous socio-economic factors, our econometric models imply that antebellum votes—the 1860 vote for Lincoln and an 1846 referendum on black suffrage—have statistically significant predictive power for the 2008 vote for Barack Obama. Antebellum support for emancipation and the rights of blacks in New York emerged primarily in ‘Yankee’ counties founded by migrants from New England, the descendants of English Puritans. In contrast, so-called ‘Yorker’ counties founded by the Dutch or other groups were less amenable to reforms promoting racial equality. Our estimates indicate that differences in antebellum cultural factors predict an additional Obama vote of 2 − 4% points. This correlation of factors dated some 150 years apart suggests persistence of culture in voting behavior, and the consistency of moral expression in this voting behavior lends support to the ethical voter hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous learning is a fundamental aspect of education that builds important skills, like critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability, which are important for achievement in a constantly changing professional environment. Cultivating it promotes lifelong learning, self-improvement, and knowledge beyond traditional educational settings. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the impact of the investigated autonomous learning approach to learners, and assess their ability to sustain the learning process, hence fostering lifelong learning within the framework of formal education. An Autonomous Learning Model (ALM) based 14-week qualitative study examined learners' work and reflections. Theme-based analysis was conducted with 62 fourth-semester English-language learners. A six-stage thematic analysis discovered coded responses' themes. The ALM examined the following key aspects of individual development: personal responsibility, positive self-esteem, decision-making, problem-solving, interpersonal skills, critical and creative thinking abilities, and a strong enthusiasm for learning. The results showed that autonomous learning is achievable, and that instructors’ support and institutional collaboration will improve new curriculum and courses. This study aims to enhance semester-end evaluations, leading to significant improvements for future language-programed learners and ensuring the sustainability of their learning.",

        "abstract": "Background Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a critical training tool in healthcare, shaping learners’ skills, professional identities, and inclusivity. Leadership demographics in SBME, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialties, influence program design and learner outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms increasingly generate demographic data, but their biases may perpetuate inequities in representation. This study evaluated the demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs generated by three AI platforms—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—across nine global locations. Methods A global cross-sectional study was conducted over 5 days (November 2024). Standardized English prompts were used to generate demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Outputs included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialty data for 2014 instructors and 1880 lab heads. Statistical analyses included ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical data, with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons: P significant < 0.05. Results Significant demographic differences were observed among AI platforms. Claude profiles depicted older heads of simulation labs (mean: 57 years) compared to instructors (mean: 41 years), while ChatGPT and Gemini showed smaller age gaps. Gender representation varied, with ChatGPT and Gemini generating balanced profiles, while Claude showed a male predominance (63.5%) among lab heads. ChatGPT and Gemini outputs reflected greater racial diversity, with up to 24.4% Black and 20.6% Hispanic/Latin representation, while Claude predominantly featured White profiles (47.8%). Specialty preferences also differed, with Claude favoring anesthesiology and surgery, whereas ChatGPT and Gemini offered broader interdisciplinary representation. Conclusions AI-generated demographic profiles of SBME leadership reveal biases that may reinforce inequities in healthcare education. ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated broader diversity in age, gender, and race, while Claude skewed towards older, White, and male profiles, particularly for leadership roles. Addressing these biases through ethical AI development, enhanced AI literacy, and promoting diverse leadership in SBME are essential to fostering equitable and inclusive training environments. Trial registration Not applicable. This study exclusively used AI-generated synthetic data.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 14% of the US adult population, yet patient knowledge about kidney disease and engagement in their kidney health is low despite many CKD education programs, awareness campaigns, and clinical practice guidelines. Objective We aimed to examine the impact of the Kidney Score Platform (a patient-facing, risk-based online tool that provides interactive health information tailored to an individual’s CKD risk plus an accompanying clinician-facing Clinical Practice Toolkit) on individual engagement with CKD health and CKD communication between clinicians and patients. Methods We conducted a pre-post intervention study in which English-speaking veterans at risk for CKD in two primary care settings interacted with the Kidney Score platform’s educational modules and their primary care clinicians were encouraged to review the Clinical Practice Toolkit. The impact of the Kidney Score on the Patient Activation Measure (the primary outcome), knowledge about CKD, and communication with their clinician about kidney health was determined with paired t tests. Multivariable linear and logistic models were used to determine whether changes in outcomes after versus before intervention were influenced by age, race or ethnicity, sex, and diabetes status, accounting for baseline values. Results The study population (n=76) had a mean (SD) age of 64.4 (8.2) years, 88% (67/76) was male, and 30.3% (23/76) self-identified as African-American. Approximately 93% (71/76) had hypertension, 36% (27/76) had diabetes, and 9.2% (7/76) had CKD according to the laboratory criteria but without an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition) diagnosis. Patient interaction with the Kidney Score did not change the mean Patient Activation Measure (preintervention: 40.7%, postintervention: 40.2%, P=.23) but increased the mean CKD knowledge score (preintervention: 40.0%, postintervention 51.1%, P<.01), and changed the percentage of veterans who discussed CKD with their clinician (preintervention: 12.3%, postintervention: 31.5%, P<.01). Changes did not differ by age, sex, race, or diabetes status. Results were limited by the small sample size due to low recruitment and minimal clinician engagement with the Clinical Practice Toolkit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions One-time web-based tailored education for patients can increase CKD knowledge and encourage conversations about kidney health. Increasing patient activation for CKD management may require multilevel, longitudinal interventions that facilitate ongoing conversations about kidney health between patients and clinician teams.",

        "abstract": "Background Pregnancy and birth cohort studies are essential for studying the social and biological determinants of human health, yet racial and ethnic minority populations are underrepresented due to low recruitment and retention rates. Remote data collection has potential to improve recruitment of underrepresented populations. The aims of this descriptive qualitative study were to explore the perspectives of pregnant and postpartum women about the barriers and facilitators to enrolling themselves, their child, and their partner in a longitudinal birth cohort study, identify data collection strategies to address barriers, and generate recommendations for future cohort studies. Methods Online focus groups and in-person interviews in English and Spanish were conducted between August and November 2022 with pregnant and postpartum women. Participants were recruited from Black and Hispanic serving obstetric clinics and community-based health and social organizations to ensure a racially and ethnically diverse sample. Analysis was conducted using an inductive thematic approach. Results 60 women participated in 10 focus groups and 11 interviews. Five themes emerged: challenges in committing time and resources to a research study; utility of compensation and resources; fears that research procedures would negatively impact child; concerns regarding data privacy and children's consent; and benefits for their family, community, and society. Black participants voiced concern about historical discrimination in science and mistrust of research, but also wanted to increase Black representation in research for future generations. Spanish-speaking participants expressed hesitancy related to fear of child injury and misuse of data. Women felt their partners would be reluctant to participate, but that incentives such as parental education would be motivating. Participants liked the flexibility of remote data collection in easing logistical challenges to participation but also expressed importance of personal study contact for facilitating access to resources, enhancing trust in the research process, and motivating retention. Participants also expressed the importance of transparency in data collection procedures and communication on study progress. Conclusions Leveraging technological advances in remote data collection may reduce some challenges to recruitment of women and families to birth cohort studies. However, building and maintaining trust among communities with engagement, transparency, and communication is critical for recruitment of underrepresented populations.

        "abstract": "Purpose of Review Despite cervical cancer (CC) being a cancer that can be eliminated, CC disparities persist such that minoritized populations shoulder a disproportionate mortality burden. This may reflect upstream, fundamental drivers of health that impede equitable access to prevention, screening, early detection, and treatment among some groups. This systematic review summarizes evidence on the relationships between structural racism and CC care across the continuum. Recent Findings Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search for peer-reviewed, English-language studies relevant to our research question that were published from 2012–2022 using PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase. Of 8,924 articles identified, 4,383 duplicates were removed, and 4,541 underwent screening, with 206 articles meeting eligibility criteria for inclusion in our data synthesis. Among reviewed studies, 60.2% (n = 124) compared CC outcomes by race and ethnicity, often as proxies for upstream racism. Key findings included evidence of lower CC screening rates among Asian American and Pacific Islander women and higher rates among Black and Hispanic/Latinx women. Barriers to healthcare access and socioeconomic status (SES) factors contributed to delayed follow-up, later-stage CC diagnoses, and poorer outcomes, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latinx women and those residing in low-SES neighborhoods. Summary This review underscores associations between race, ethnicity, SES, and outcomes across the CC continuum. Most studies examined racial and ethnic disparities in the outcomes of interest rather than directly evaluating measures of structural racism. Future research should refine measures of structural racism to deepen our understanding of its impact on CC across the care continuum.

        "title": "The Discursive Strategies in the Spoken Narratives of Multilingual Sepitori and Sesotho Speakers",
        "abstract": "In linguistically diverse and multilingual South African communities, it is common to use non-standard language varieties (NSLVs), often called mixed languages, as lingua franca. These NSLVs are primarily spoken in black townships throughout South Africa. Previous studies show that the discursive production of oral narratives impacts the development and use of higher-order language processing, as they require the knowledge, language skills and abilities to produce coherent discourse. The main focus of the existing literature in oral narrative is mostly on standard languages. In this study, we explore how speakers of Sepitori, a non-standard language variety (NSLV), produce an oral narrative compared to Sesotho, a standard language. The current study investigates the oral narrative production of a total number of 20 participants who are adult speakers of Sesotho and Sepitori (ten from each language). The Sesotho speakers were bilingual speakers of English and Sesotho. The Sepitori speakers were multilingual speakers of English, Sesotho, Zulu and other languages spoken in the Mamelodi township. This study used a mixed methodology of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Narratives were annotated for language complexity in the macro- and microstructure elements: the length and type of clause, pragmatic acts, referential lexical choices and code-switched words. Sepitori speakers produced narratives characterised by interactive clauses unrelated to the narrative level and with a greater range of lexical referents, showcasing more individual linguistic variation. Sesotho speakers produced a more sequential oral narrative in line with story schema with fewer interjections to the researcher. In an increasingly linguistically heterogeneous South Africa, more research is required to gain insights into how multilingual individuals develop and refine their narrative skills, emphasising the much-needed focus on NSLV from a psycholinguistic perspective, which may ultimately inform tools of assessment for multilingual children and adults in social, clinical and academic contexts.",

        "abstract": "This article addresses bias in Spoken Language Systems (SLS) that involve both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and reports experiments to improve the performance of SLS for automated language and literacy‐related assessments with students who are under served in the U.S. educational system. We frame bias in SLS in terms of testing fairness and validity, stemming in part from the exclusion of sufficiently large training datasets in varieties of English other than General American English (GAE). We adopt an Interpretation/Use Argument approach to validity focused on clarity of constructs and scoring accuracy. While SLS use ASR to automatically transcribe students’ utterances, and apply NLP algorithms to ASR transcripts to measure students’ speech samples, it is well‐documented in studies with adults that ASR is typically more problematic for African American English (AAE) speakers than for other groups due to differences in prosody, pronunciation, word usage, and grammar. We utilized child speech and text corpora to improve algorithms that score oral task responses for child AAE speakers and, in some experiments, children with oral language and reading difficulties. Favorable results provide impetus and possible solutions for fair and inclusive assessments for diverse student groups in the future.",

        "title": "Unequal access to diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis in England",
        "abstract": "Background People with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS; sometimes referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome) experience poor health-related quality of life and only rarely recover. ME/CFS has no curative treatment, and no single diagnostic test. Public health and policy decisions relevant to ME/CFS require knowledge of its prevalence and barriers to diagnosis. However, people with ME/CFS report lengthy diagnostic delays and prevalence estimates vary greatly due to uneven diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Factors that influence diagnosis could be revealed by stratifying a single population by gender, age and ethnicity. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics data, routinely collected by the NHS in England, was downloaded from the Feasibility Self-Service of NHS DigiTrials. This was used to stratify individuals with the ICD-10 code that best reflects ME/CFS symptoms (G93.3) according to age, self-reported gender and ethnicity, General Practice and NHS England Integrated Care Board (ICB). Results In all, 100,055 people in England had been diagnosed with ME/CFS (ICD-10:G93.3) between April 1 1989 and October 7 2023, 0.16% of all registered patients. Of these, 79,445 were females and 20,590 males, a female-to-male ratio of 3.88:1. Female relative to male prevalence peaked at about 6-to-1 in individuals’ fourth and fifth decades of life. Prevalence varied widely across the 42 ICBs: 0.086%-0.82% for females and 0.024%-0.21% for males. White individuals were approximately fivefold more likely to be diagnosed with ME/CFS than others; Black, Asian or Chinese ethnicities are associated with particularly low rates of ME/CFS diagnoses. This ethnicity bias is stronger than for other common diseases. Among active English GP practices, 176 (3%) had no registered ME/CFS patients. Eight ICBs (19%) each contained fewer than 8 other-than-white individuals with a G93.3 code despite their registers containing a total of 293,770 other-than-white patients. Conclusion Other-than-white ethnic groups, older females (> 60y), older males (> 80y), and people living in areas of multiple deprivation are disproportionately undiagnosed with ME/CFS. Lifetime prevalence of ME/CFS for English females and males may be as high as 0.92% and 0.25%, respectively, or approximately 404,000 UK individuals overall (0.6%). This improved estimate of ME/CFS prevalence allows more accurate assessment of the socioeconomic and disease burden imposed by ME/CFS.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAs European healthcare systems struggle with increasing workload and sustainability issues, it is estimated that 20% of their production is ineffective. One potential strategy to reduce this excess is by minimizing the use of unnecessary laboratory tests. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of presenting physicians in Europe with the cost of laboratory tests at the time of ordering on the quantities and expense of laboratory tests as well as to identify knowledge gaps on this matter.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was conducted in February 2025. Studies were included if written in English and conducted in Europe. There were no restrictions on year of publication. Study quality was evaluated using a modified Downs and Black checklist.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 2185 publications identified, five met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were published 2002-2021 and found a reduction in order cost and/or volume of laboratory test, following price display (four with statistically significant results). The reduction in order costs were greater than the reduction in order volume. Additionally, the impact of price display diminished over time as the intervention period continued. None of the studies included patient safety measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrice display is a simple yet potentially impactful intervention as it is likely to reduce both the cost and volume of tests, thereby decreasing the workload and enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine if price display is a patient-safe intervention.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare holds transformative potential but faces critical challenges in ethical accountability and systemic inequities. Biases in AI models, such as lower diagnosis rates for Black women or gender stereotyping in Large Language Models, highlight the urgent need to address historical and structural inequalities in data and development processes. Disparities in clinical trials and datasets, often skewed toward high-income, English-speaking regions, amplify these issues. Moreover, the underrepresentation of marginalized groups among AI developers and researchers exacerbates these challenges. To ensure equitable AI, diverse data collection, federated data-sharing frameworks, and bias-correction techniques are essential. Structural initiatives, such as fairness audits, transparent AI model development processes, and early registration of clinical AI models, alongside inclusive global collaborations like TRAIN-Europe and CHAI, can drive responsible AI adoption. Prioritizing diversity in datasets and among developers and researchers, as well as implementing transparent governance will foster AI systems that uphold ethical principles and deliver equitable healthcare outcomes globally.",

        "abstract": "A cross-sectional study was conducted with Brazilian adults from the 2019 Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde (PNS 2019; National Health Survey, in English) who self-declared race/skin color white or black (n = 87,187), to investigate racial inequality in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression. Symptom-based depression was screened using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff ≥ 10), while medical diagnosis was self-reported. Prevalence of agreement (presence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) and disagreement (absence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) were compared according to race/skin color. The Odds Ratio (OR) for the association between both depression indicators and race/skin color were estimated by Logistic regression adjusted by socioeconomic variables. The black population had a higher prevalence of symptom-based depression than medical diagnosis (11.0% versus 8.6%; 2.5 percentual points (pp)), with greater differences among younger adults (6.0 pp), without a partner (3.6 pp), with lower income (3.9 pp), education (3.0 pp), less developed regions (north: 3.6 pp; northeast: 4.2 pp) and those with recent access to medical care (4.5 pp). The white population had a higher prevalence of medical diagnosis than symptom-based depression (10.6% versus 12.5%; -1.9 pp), with greater differences between those with higher income (-7.4 pp), education (-4.5 pp) and from south region (-6.0 pp). Disagreement was higher among black individuals while agreement was higher among white, with significant inequality among women for both agreement (33.5% in black versus 41.7% in white) and disagreement (66.5% in black versus 58.3% in white). The black population had a lower chance of having medical diagnosis of depression (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.70-0.84) than white, regardless of socioeconomic variables. Racial inequality was identified in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression, with greater inequality among women and those with lower income and education.",

The participants included 214 middle and high school students (116 females), with a diverse demographic composition: 71.5% Hispanic, 10% White, 7% Pacific Islander, 5.6% Asian American, 2% African American, and 0.5% Native American. Students were asked to write an argumentative text after reading sources related to a historical topic in history class, and the quality of their essays was rated. Their social perspective taking was measured using a scenario-based assessment where students were presented with scenarios with social conflicts and provided open-ended responses related to various perspectives. These responses were coded based on their articulation, simple, and complex positioning. Structural equation modeling revealed that female students, although marginally significant, tended to have higher levels of social perspective taking compared to their male counterparts after controlling for English learner status, race/ethnicity, poverty status, and grade level. Additionally, perspective taking was positively related to the quality of argumentative writing after controlling for student demographic backgrounds. Future research should explore various dimensions of perspective taking and their impacts on writing in different genres to enhance our understanding of the relation between perspective taking and writing.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to review scientific publications on reports of violence against children and adolescents in Brazil from 2018 to 2022 based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. Selection encompassed quantitative and qualitative studies published in Portuguese, English, and Spanish from the PubMed Central, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Two trilingual reviewers analyzed the studies according to the eligibility criteria, and the quality of the studies was assessed using the Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The 21 eligible studies were then analyzed, and the social determinants of health listed were grouped into categories (territory, race/ethnicity, gender, age, type of violence, drugs, perpetrator, and where the act occurred) to create a narrative synthesis about each one. The results show worrisome patterns of ethnic-racial inequalities regarding violence, pointing towards a greater vulnerability of the black population. Analyses based on gender, age, and type of violence also reveal a particular vulnerability of girls, especially regarding sexual violence. The perpetrators were mainly identified as the victims’ fathers and mothers, highlighting the relevance of the family setting in enabling violent acts and showing the need for interventions focused on this context. The underreporting of cases indicates the importance of improving report mechanisms and raising community awareness to ensure that the reality of violence against children and adolescents is presented accurately.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Wisconsin, with higher rates in Black/African American (Black) and Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) populations. In partnership with Milwaukee Recreation (MKE Rec), Total Wellness (TW) was created to provide lifestyle and cancer prevention programming to local communities. Program feasibility, potential efficacy, and sustainability were evaluated. TW is a 16-week program integrated into MKE Rec and implemented over two 8-week sessions led by instructors trained in lifestyle change and cancer prevention. TW was evaluated at the individual and systems level. Class registrants were invited to participate in the evaluation, which included surveys and a physical assessment. Sixty participants consented to the program evaluation: 58.3% self-identified as Black and 7.3% as Hispanic. Survey results indicated significant improvements in cancer knowledge, self-reported diet, and physical activity. Physical assessment showed significant improvements in weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and fitness. System-wise, three MKE Rec instructors were trained, and classes operated out of two sites, serving a predominantly Black neighborhood and a large Hispanic population. English-taught sessions of TW showed successful integration into MKE Rec programming throughout 2 years. Spanish-language only classes were attempted but did not meet minimum enrollment to proceed. TW showed success in improving individual cancer awareness and healthy lifestyle changes. TW was also integrated into MKE Rec and showed sustained success in reaching Black communities with limited reach in Hispanic communities. This program demonstrates the potential for a community health intervention program to address cancer disparities.",

        "abstract": "Background Data science approaches have been pivotal in addressing public health challenges. However, there has been limited focus on identifying essential data science skills for health researchers, gaps in capacity building provision, barriers to access, and potential solutions. Objectives This review aims to identify essential data science skills for health researchers and key stakeholders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as well as to explore gaps and barriers in data science capacity building and share potential solutions, including any regional variations. Methods An online survey was conducted in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, gathering both quantitative and qualitative responses. Descriptive analysis was performed in R V4.3, and a thematic workshop approach facilitated qualitative analysis. Findings From 262 responses from individuals across 54 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), representing various institutions and roles, we summarised essential data science skills globally and by region. Thematic analysis revealed key gaps and barriers in capacity building, including limited training resources, lack of mentoring, challenges with data quality, infrastructure and privacy issues, and the absence of a conducive research environment. Conclusion and future directions Respondents’ consensus on essential data science skills suggests the need for a standardised framework for capacity building, adaptable to regional contexts. Greater investment, coupled with expanded collaboration and networking, would help address gaps and barriers, fostering a robust data science ecosystem and advancing insights into global health challenges.",

        "abstract": "Objectives/Goals: To create raciolinguistically sensitive emotion recognition assessment materials, we will (i) identify the prosodic cues that signal differences between raciolects (Black vs. White American English) and (ii) identify the prosodic cues that signal different emotions (angry, happy, and sad). Methods/Study Population: Research evaluating prosodic differences between raciolects and emotions both implicate pitch. For example, Black speakers tend to produce speech lower in pitch, and sad speech tends to be narrower in pitch range. In our study, 50 Black and 50 White American healthy adults will hear manipulated recordings of Black and White speakers uttering pseudoword strings that vary by mean pitch and pitch range. In the race task, participants will choose whether the stimulus was produced by a Black or White speaker. In the emotion task, they will choose whether the stimulus sounded happy, angry, or sad. Linear mixed-effects models will be used to determine the pitch correlates for each emotion by race. Results/Anticipated Results: If mean pitch (high, low) and pitch range (wide, narrow) function as acoustic correlates for emotions but differ by race, we expect the following: first, members in each participant group (Black, White) will converge on correlates that differentiate emotions and race; and second, the emotion correlates will differ between groups. Preliminary results using stimuli from only White speakers suggest convergence across groups for emotions (angry: low mean pitch, happy: high mean pitch, and sad: narrow pitch range) but not race. Ongoing data collection including stimuli from White and Black speakers will be used to conduct planned comparisons as well as test same-race, different-race differences. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Characterizing the prosodic differences in emotion recognition between races helps us understand disparities in post-stroke aprosodia. Additionally, developing a linguistically informed strategy for assessing deficits between dialects can be readily implemented across diverse linguistic communities.",

        "abstract": "Idioms are non-compositional expressions whose meanings transcend the literal interpretation of their components (e.g., “break the ice”). They highlight the psycholinguistic tension between direct retrieval and compositional semantic analysis. Past research suggests L1 readers rely more on direct retrieval and idiom familiarity, while L2 readers depend more on word-by-word compositional processing. Supporting this, studies show that disrupting an idiom’s canonical form impacts L1 readers more than L2 readers. This study explored the reverse effect by strengthening an idiom’s canonical form through font color. L1 and L2 readers read English sentences containing idiomatic/literal phrases, presented in colored/standard font, and judged whether the phrases made sense. Accuracy and reaction times were recorded. In L1 readers, idiom superiority (i.e., better performance for idioms than literal phrases) was driven by familiarity, with color coding enhancing this effect for more familiar idioms. In L2 readers, idiom superiority was influenced by both familiarity and decomposability, with color coding amplifying both effects. These findings suggest that L1 readers primarily rely on direct retrieval, whereas L2 readers utilize both direct retrieval and compositional processing, with color coding aiding idiomatic processing for both groups.",

        "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 public health emergency catalyzed widespread adoption of both video- and audio-only telemedicine visits. This proliferation highlighted inequities in use by age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language. Few studies have investigated how differences in health system telemedicine implementation affected these inequities. Objective This study aims to describe patients who used telemedicine during the public health emergency and identify predictors of telemedicine use across 2 health systems with different telemedicine implementations. Methods This retrospective cohort study included adults with diabetes receiving primary care between July 2020 and March 2021 at 2 independent health systems in San Francisco, California. Participant sociodemographic characteristics, health information, and telemedicine utilization were acquired from electronic health records. The primary outcome was visit type (any audio or video telemedicine vs in-person only) during the study period. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between visit type and key predictors associated with digital exclusion (age, race and ethnicity, preferred language, and neighborhood socioeconomic status), adjusting for baseline health. We included an interaction term to evaluate health system impact on each predictor and then stratified by health system (academic, which prioritized video-enabled visits, vs safety net, which prioritized audio-only visits). Results Among 10,201 patients, we found higher odds of telemedicine use in the safety net system compared with the academic system (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.94, 95% CI 2.48-3.48). Patients with younger age (18-34 years: aOR 2.55, 95% CI 1.63-3.97; 35-49 years: aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.73 vs 75+ years) and Chinese-language preference (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.66-2.5 vs English) had higher odds of having a telemedicine visit. Non-Hispanic Asian (aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.79), non-Hispanic Black (aOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1), and Hispanic or Latine (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95) patients had lower odds of having a telemedicine visit than non-Hispanic White patients. We found significant interactions between health system and age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language (P<.05). After stratifying by health system, several differences persisted in the academic system: non-Hispanic Asian (aOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.70) and Latine (aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) patients had lower odds of a telemedicine visit, and younger age groups had higher odds (18-34 years: aOR 3.97, 95% CI 1.99-7.93; 35-49 years: aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.36-2.56). In the safety net system, Chinese-speaking patients had higher odds of having a telemedicine visit (aOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.85-3.42). Conclusions We found disparities in telemedicine utilization by age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language, primarily in the health system that used more video visits. While telemedicine expanded rapidly recently, certain populations remain at risk for digital exclusion. These findings suggest that system-level factors influence telemedicine adoption and implementation decisions impact accessibility for populations at risk for digital exclusion.",

        "abstract": "We quantify the representation, or presence, of characters of color in English Language Arts (ELA) instruction in the United States to better understand possible racial/ethnic emphases and gaps in literary curricula. We contribute two datasets: the first consists of books listed in widely-adopted Advanced Placement (AP) Literature & Composition exams, and the second is a set of books taught by teachers surveyed from schools with substantial Black and Hispanic student populations. In addition to these book lists, we provide an unprecedented collection of hand-annotated sociodemographic labels of not only literary authors, but also their characters. We use computational methods to measure all main characters’ presence through three distinct and nuanced metrics: frequency, narrative perspective, and burstiness. Our annotations and measurements show that the sociodemographic composition of characters in books recommended by AP Literature has not shifted much for over twenty years. As a case study of how ELA curricula may deviate from the curricula prescribed by AP, our teacher-provided sample shows a greater emphasis on books featuring first-person, primary characters of color. We also find that only a few books in either dataset feature both White main characters and main characters of color. Arguably, these books may uphold a view of racial/ethnic segregation as a societal norm.",

        "abstract": "This article examines Ernest J. Gaines' The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1972) as a parody and critique of dominant cultural narratives. Combining close reading with biographical criticism, which contextualizes the novel through Gaines’ socio-cultural background as an African American author. Drawing on Bakhtin’s and Hannoosh’s theories of parody and Gates’ concept of chiasmus, the analysis explores how the novel imitates, transforms, and subverts its targets. Bhabha’s notion of mimicry situates parody within postcolonial discourse, while Genette’s theory of frequency analyzes the novel’s repetitive narrative structures. Ashcroft, Griffiths, and Tiffin’s concepts of appropriation and abrogation address Gaines’ use of English, shaped by his identity as a Black writer from Louisiana and his California education. Bakhtin’s heteroglossia highlights the novel’s polyphonic structure, reflecting its diverse voices. Ong’s theories of orality and literacy contrast Louisiana’s oral traditions with Gaines’ literary techniques. Interviews with Gaudet and Wooton reveal the influence of white literary traditions on Gaines, situating him within African American literary frameworks. Loomba’s critique of colonial discourse positions the novel as a subversive response to white supremacy. Thus, the objective of this study is to demonstrate that Gaines uses parody in the Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman as both a literary form and an ideological tool to challenge hegemonic narratives and amplify African American voices.",

        "title": "Enhancing Patient-Physician Communication: Simulating African American Vernacular English in Medical Diagnostics with Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Effective communication is crucial in reducing health disparities. However, linguistic differences, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE), can lead to communication gaps between patients and physicians, negatively affecting care and outcomes. This study examines whether large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Llama 3.3, can replicate AAVE in simulated clinical dialogues to improve cultural sensitivity. We tested four prompt types—BaseP, DemoP, LingP, and CompP—using United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) case simulations. Statistical analyses on the models’ outputs showed a significant difference among prompt types for both GPT-4 (F(2,70) = 6.218, p = 0.003) and Llama 3.3 (F(2,70) = 12.124, p < 0.001), indicating that including demographic information and/or explicit AAVE cues influences each model’s output. Combining demographic and linguistic cues (CompP) yielded the highest mean AAVE feature counts (e.g., 9.83 for GPT-4 vs. 16.06 for Llama 3.3), although neither model fully captured the diversity of AAVE. Moreover, simply mentioning African American demographics triggers extra informal forms, suggesting built-in stereotypes or biases in both models. Overall, these findings highlight the promise of LLMs for culturally sensitive healthcare communication, while underscoring the need for continued refinement to address stereotypes and more accurately represent diverse linguistic styles.

        "abstract": "Abstract Amidst resurging syphilis infection rates, increasing efforts are being made towards development of a syphilis vaccine. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators of syphilis vaccine trial participation among priority groups for early phase studies. We conducted interviews with English-speaking individuals ≥18 years old recruited from an infectious disease clinic, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing site, an online research bulletin board, and HIV community advisory boards in North Carolina from April 2021–June 2022. Eligibility criteria included STI diagnosis within 12 months, people living with HIV (PLWH), men who have sex with men, or persons engaged in transactional sex. The interview guide examined views on syphilis vaccines, trial participation, and community engagement. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analysed for emergent themes using a social ecological model. Thirty individuals were interviewed, including eight (27%) women, 13 (43%) Black/African American individuals, and 19 (63%) PLWH. While 19 (63%) interviewees were interested in syphilis vaccine trial participation, 10 (33%) noted participation would depend on trial parameters; one person expressed no interest. Trial participation barriers included physical risks, time commitments, and concerns related to mistrust and mistreatment. Facilitators included advancing science, syphilis prevention, and trusting the researchers. Interviewees emphasized the importance of community involvement to inform vaccine trials, particularly amidst the lingering shadow of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. While priority groups thus expressed interest in syphilis vaccine trial participation, tailored community engagement will be essential prior to clinical trials. Additional mixed methods research is urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "Translating pun discourse comparatively across languages and cultures is an arduous and challenging task that involves a more than competent level of language proficiency and dexterity. It demands advanced knowledge and apprehension of the cultural origin, social setting, and sociocultural context of the source language and translated language. This study explores cultural conceptualizations as a literary translation strategy in Arabic culture-specific pun discourse found in the poetry of the Saudi poet Ghazi Al-Gosaibi, translated into English. The study uses a descriptive qualitative approach to investigate the selected Arabic pun discourse in two poems, “Love… and the Black Ports” and “Song in a Tropical Night.” The study also suggests a literary translation strategy for rendering culture-specific puns into English cultural conceptualizations. The utmost significance of this study is how cultural conceptualizations, such as patterns, types, and social allegory, play a pivotal role in translating culture-specific puns. Results show that the translators, Sargon Boulus and Joon-Stubbs, are accurate and faithful to the original wording of the Arabic culture-specific puns in the two poems. The study found that the translators use several different translation strategies, such as literal translations and faithful translations. The study reveals that utilizing cultural conceptualizations as a literary translation strategy plays a central role in rendering Arabic culture-specific puns that lead to bridging communication gaps and minimizing the cultural gap. Such utilization helps translators adequately render puns among various cultural and language boundaries. Some significant implications and recommendations are offered.",

        "title": "Coastal cliff erosion: a bibliometric analysis and literature review",
        "abstract": "\n Cliffed (and rocky) coasts are geomorphic features occurring in about 80% of the coastline of the world and are strongly influenced by a broad range of both natural and anthropogenic processes that may cause serious erosion problems. Since the sea wave motion is a fundamental driver of cliff erosion, the cliffs become sensitive to increasing of global sea levels and to extreme weather events, which are both associated with global warming. Because of its importance, a considerable amount of investigations on coastal cliff erosion (CCE) were reported during the last decades. A bibliometric analysis is an useful tool to identify patterns of a given theme from a large body of academic literature. There is no previous evidence of a global bibliometric analysis in the literature in English on themes of CCE. Therefore, the aim of this article was to carry out a bibliometric analysis from Scopus database of CCE for the period 2000–2023. Once obtained, two filtering steps for selection of documents consisting of a custom R script implementation and a careful reading of the remaining documents were applied. During the search, a dynamic approach that puts emphasis on the processes operating on rocky coasts was selected instead of an evolutionary geological perspective. The final list reached 583 documents. A second aim was to discuss the research trends and challenges based on the latest highly-cited documents. As main result, the trend of the scientific production in the theme of CCE had an increasing interest over the last years, with an average compound annual growth rate of 15.6%. On the other side, the results demonstrated that even though the USA took the second place, European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain and Poland) lead the ranking; therefore, there is a scarcity of knowledge about the theme in large regions such as South America and Africa where seacliffs are dominants.",

        "abstract": "Background: Early childhood sun exposure contributes to lifetime risk of skin cancer. Many individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds believe their skin tone confers immunity to sun damage; however, evidence of negative outcomes exists. Best practice in photoprotection for children of color is unclear. Objective: We sought to address the risks, benefits, and needs for sun protection and education in children of color. Methods: An English-language systematic literature review was conducted. Inclusion criteria were data on children of color and content relevant to photodamage and photoprotection. Results: Photoprotection is needed for children of all skin tones with photosensitivity. Individuals with darker skin tones have more innate photoprotection compared with lighter skin tone individuals, but both have incomplete photoprotection. Risk of nevus formation, skin cancer, and dyspigmentation are universal with varying degrees. Hispanic and Black communities are less likely to practice sun protection. Studies demonstrate need for early, culturally appropriate education about sun exposure in all communities. Limitations: Studies reviewed were of varied design and populations. Conclusion: This review determined that photoprotection has benefits for all patients, and the benefits of photoprotection should be taught early to children, caregivers, and parents of all skin tones using culturally appropriate approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Pre-operative anxiety (POA) in pediatric burn patients poses a challenge for recovery, as management of burn injuries often requires multiple surgical interventions over time. With an occurrence rate between 50-75%, early identification of POA is essential to prevent and mitigate long-term psychiatric and behavioral concerns. Upon evaluation, our facility process lacked a mechanism to identify anxious patients, develop treatment plans, communicate information or provide feedback on anxiety management. To address these concerns a uniform workflow was needed. This project was undertaken as a Quality Improvement Initiative and was not formally supervised by an Institutional Review Board. Methods A multi-disciplinary workgroup evaluated processes and generated solutions. Four high-value touch points were identified offering opportunities for improvement in case management, child life, nurse practitioner and operating room (OR) roles. Key elements include prescreening, historical response to induction, anxiety-specific documentation, and inclusion of an OR huddle. (Figure 1) Optimized process was implemented on 04/01/24. Patients identified through prescreen process from 04/01/24-09/13/24 as having POA were included. Descriptive statistics and McNemar’s test for ordinal data were used to compare documentation of POA and if anxiolytics were offered between initial and most recent outpatient surgical encounters. Results A total of 55 patients with a mean burn size of 28% total body surface area and age of 2.7 years were identified as having POA. About 78.5% were injured before age 5, with 59% of patients having acute admission over 4 weeks and an average of 16.13 surgeries. Of these, 51.8% were white/non-Hispanic, 35.7% Hispanic, 8.9% Asian, and 1.8% African American; 49.1% received initial care in another country, and 47.3% were non-English speakers. There was a significant increase in provision of pre-op anxiolytics between first and last outpatient surgical encounters (8 vs 41; p=0.001). Similarly, documentation of POA plan in the history and physical increased from 13 to 47 patient records (p = 0.001). POA listed in patient problem list also significantly increased (7 vs 18; p=0.005). Conclusions Capturing patients’ POA improved post-implementation of new workflow. Multidisciplinary communication was a key component of success, but continued challenges exist. Reliable documentation within the medical record as well as engagement from all multidisciplinary members is crucial for efficiency. Applicability of Research to Practice Further research including guardian perspective on POA intervention is necessary. Funding for the Study N/A",

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 is one of the most prevalent serotypes commonly associated with invasive pneumococcal disease cases and outbreaks worldwide. Several sequence types of this serotype have been identified globally, including those exhibiting both high virulence potential and antimicrobial resistance profiles. This systematic review presents the global distribution of clones of pneumococcal serotype 1, describing their circulating patterns in various regions in the world. A database search was conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using keywords related to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1. The inclusion criteria entailed peer-reviewed studies published in English describing the utilization of at least one molecular genotyping tool to identify S. pneumoniae serotype 1 clones based on their sequence types. Data extracted were managed and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 365 (Version 2108). Forty-three studies were finally included in the systematic review. A total of 103 MLST serotype 1 sequence types were identified in 48 countries. These clones were widely reported to be associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases. Globally, ST217 and ST306 clonal complexes (CC217 and CC306) were the predominant lineages of serotype 1 sequence types, exhibiting distinct continental distribution patterns. CC217, characterized by ST217, ST303, ST612, ST618, and ST3081, was predominant in Africa and Asia. ST306 clonal complex, which is grouped into ST306, ST304, and ST227 were mostly found in Europe, Oceania, North America, and some countries in South America. ST615 was predominant in Chile, Peru, and Argentina. The hypervirulence nature of serotype 1, coupled with its complex genetic diversity, poses a significant public health threat. Our findings emphasize the need for enhanced surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of these hypervirulent clones, ultimately informing evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control.",

        "abstract": "Background Health inequalities exist globally, but limited data exist on this topic for bacteraemia. Aim In this study we investigated health inequalities surrounding bacteraemia in England, to identify high-risk population groups and areas of intervention. Methods We retrospectively analysed English surveillance data between 2018 and 2022 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and both meticillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA) bacteraemia. Crude incidence rates stratified by index of multiple deprivation and ethnic groups were calculated; age-adjusted rate ratios were estimated using negative binomial regression models. Results We identified 342,787 bacteraemia cases. Across all pathogens, as the level of deprivation rose, so did the age-adjusted bacteraemia incidence rate ratio. Compared with residents of the 20% least deprived areas of England, residents of the 20% most deprived areas had a 2.68-fold increased bacteraemia rate for MRSA (95% CI: 2.29–3.13) and 1.95-fold for E. coli (95% CI: 1.84–2.05), and 15% higher odds of dying within 30 days of any bacteraemia (95% CI: 1.13–1.19). After age adjustment, the incidence of all bacteraemia was higher in the Asian and Black groups compared with the White group: for MRSA, 79% higher in the Asian (95% CI: 1.51–2.10) and 59% higher in the Black (95% CI: 1.29–1.95) groups. The exception was MSSA, whose incidence was highest in the White group. Conclusion Disproportionately higher age-adjusted incidence of bacteraemia occurred in deprived areas and ethnic minorities. These disparities are likely multifactorial, possibly including socioeconomic, cultural, and systemic risk factors and different burden of comorbidities. Better understanding these factors can enable targeted interventions.",

        "title": "Health Literacy and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Scores Among Patients Referred to Spine Surgeons",
        "abstract": "Background Health literacy is “the degree to which individuals can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.\" Low health literacy is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as increased risk and length of hospitalization after abdominal surgery. However, the impact of health literacy on outcomes in the spine surgery patient population is understudied. This study seeks to evaluate the relationship between patients' health literacy scores and various outcomes, primarily a patient's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) score at their baseline visit with a spine surgeon. A greater understanding of the impact of health literacy on health outcomes may improve treatment for patients with lower health literacy. Methods This is a single-center retrospective study at New York University (NYU) Langone Orthopedic Center. A health literacy measurement survey (i.e., the Newest Vital Sign survey) was administered to English-speaking adult patients aged 18 years and older who presented to two attending spine surgeons between June 1, 2022, and August 15, 2022, as new or follow-up patients. The survey consists of six questions, and patients were categorized into two different health literacy levels based on the number of correct responses. A score of 0-3 suggests limited literacy, and a score of 4-6 indicates adequate literacy. Additional data collected include PROMIS at the patient’s baseline appointment with the surgeon to create consistency between new and follow-up patients. Key demographic and clinical data were also collected. Univariate associations between health literacy and PROMIS scores were investigated using the Welch Two Sample t-test and Pearson's Chi-squared test. A multivariate analysis was carried out implementing a binary logistic regression model. Results This study included 57 patients with an average age of 57 years, 29 (51%) of whom identified as female. The racial breakdown of this cohort was 33 (58%) White, 11 (19%) Black, 5 (9%) Asian, and 5 (9%) Hispanic. The health literacy survey results demonstrated that 25 (44%) had limited health literacy, and 32 (56%) had adequate health literacy. Limited literacy patients were older (mean age of 62 years for Limited vs. 54 years for Adequate, P=0.024) and more likely to be patients of color (either Asian, Black, or Hispanic) (15 (60%) Limited vs. 6 (19%) Adequate, P = 0.002). Limited literacy patients also, on average, had a lower self-reported physical health score (36.6 for Limited vs. 41.2 for Adequate, P=0.050) and were more likely to have hypertension (20 (80%) Limited vs. 10 (31%) Adequate, P<0.001). A logistic regression model yielded an odds ratio of 1.16 between patient-reported physical health and health literacy, indicating that the odds of having adequate health literacy increase by about 16% for each unit increase in the Physical Health score. A Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test was used and demonstrated minimal multicollinearity among the variables in the logistic regression. Conclusion This study shows that health literacy plays a significant role in health outcomes, especially in chronic health conditions like physical health for spine surgery patients and hypertension. These results align with the literature, showing how lower health literacy correlates with worse physical health scores and a greater incidence of hypertension.",

        "title": "Therapeutic Exercise Prescription for Overhead Athletes with Shoulder Impingement Syndrome: A Systematic Review and CERT Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background: Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is a prevalent condition among overhead athletes, often managed through therapeutic exercise interventions. However, the quality of reporting in exercise protocols significantly impacts their reproducibility and clinical implementation. The Consensus for Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) provides a standardized framework to assess the quality of exercise reporting in clinical research. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the quality of exercise protocols used to treat SIS in overhead athletes by applying the CERT checklist. Additionally, the risk of bias was assessed to determine the methodological rigor of included studies. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Sport Discuss, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series that investigated exercise therapy for SIS in overhead athletes. Studies had to be published in English and provide details on exercise interventions. Exclusion criteria included non-human studies, acute injuries, and postoperative management. The primary outcome was the quality of intervention reporting, assessed using the CERT checklist. The secondary outcome was the risk of bias, evaluated using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising four RCTs and one case series. CERT scores ranged from 6 to 13 (median = 8, IQR = 1), indicating suboptimal reporting quality. Commonly reported CERT items included equipment usage and exercise tailoring. However, key aspects such as adherence, motivation, and intervention fidelity were consistently underreported. None of the included studies provided comprehensive details on exercise interventions as per CERT guidelines, limiting their reproducibility and clinical application. Conclusions: The quality of reporting on exercise-based interventions for SIS in overhead athletes remains insufficient. Critical gaps in adherence monitoring, patient motivation, and intervention fidelity were identified. Future research should prioritize standardized and detailed reporting of exercise interventions to enhance reproducibility and facilitate evidence-based clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Social Feedback Speech Technologies (SFST) are programs and devices, often “AI”-powered, that claim to provide users with feedback about how their speech sounds to other humans. To date, academic research has not focused on how such systems perform for a variety of speakers. In 2020, Amazon released a wearable called Halo, touting its fitness and sleep tracking, as well as its ability to evaluate the wearer’s voice to help them “understand how they sound to others”. The band presents its wearer with ‘Positivity’ and ‘Energy’ scores, as well as qualitative evaluations of the voice: adjectives such as ‘confident’, ‘hesitant’, ‘calm’, etc. This study evaluates how Halo performs for American English speakers of different races and genders. We recorded Black and white men and women reading three passages aloud and played them back to the same Halo device in identical positions. We then obtained Halo’s Energy and Positivity scores (out of 100), as well as the device’s qualitative descriptors of ‘tone of voice’ for each subject. We subsequently analyzed effects of different acoustic properties, as well as speaker race/gender and the interaction, for how the device scores ‘tone of voice’. Overall, Halo’s Energy ratings and qualitative descriptors are biased against women and Black speakers. Halo’s Positivity scores appear to be based on lexical sentiment analysis and therefore do not vary substantially by speaker. We conclude by discussing the expanding role of SFSTs and their potential harms related to the reinforcement of existing societal and algorithmic biases against marginalized speakers.",

        "abstract": "Background Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) is emerging as a promising digital technology for mental health care. CAI apps, such as psychotherapeutic chatbots, are available in app stores, but their use raises ethical concerns. Objective We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of ethical considerations surrounding CAI as a therapist for individuals with mental health issues. Methods We conducted a systematic search across PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, the Philosopher’s Index, and ACM Digital Library databases. Our search comprised 3 elements: embodied artificial intelligence, ethics, and mental health. We defined CAI as a conversational agent that interacts with a person and uses artificial intelligence to formulate output. We included articles discussing the ethical challenges of CAI functioning in the role of a therapist for individuals with mental health issues. We added additional articles through snowball searching. We included articles in English or Dutch. All types of articles were considered except abstracts of symposia. Screening for eligibility was done by 2 independent researchers (MRM and TS or AvB). An initial charting form was created based on the expected considerations and revised and complemented during the charting process. The ethical challenges were divided into themes. When a concern occurred in more than 2 articles, we identified it as a distinct theme. Results We included 101 articles, of which 95% (n=96) were published in 2018 or later. Most were reviews (n=22, 21.8%) followed by commentaries (n=17, 16.8%). The following 10 themes were distinguished: (1) safety and harm (discussed in 52/101, 51.5% of articles); the most common topics within this theme were suicidality and crisis management, harmful or wrong suggestions, and the risk of dependency on CAI; (2) explicability, transparency, and trust (n=26, 25.7%), including topics such as the effects of “black box” algorithms on trust; (3) responsibility and accountability (n=31, 30.7%); (4) empathy and humanness (n=29, 28.7%); (5) justice (n=41, 40.6%), including themes such as health inequalities due to differences in digital literacy; (6) anthropomorphization and deception (n=24, 23.8%); (7) autonomy (n=12, 11.9%); (8) effectiveness (n=38, 37.6%); (9) privacy and confidentiality (n=62, 61.4%); and (10) concerns for health care workers’ jobs (n=16, 15.8%). Other themes were discussed in 9.9% (n=10) of the identified articles. Conclusions Our scoping review has comprehensively covered ethical aspects of CAI in mental health care. While certain themes remain underexplored and stakeholders’ perspectives are insufficiently represented, this study highlights critical areas for further research. These include evaluating the risks and benefits of CAI in comparison to human therapists, determining its appropriate roles in therapeutic contexts and its impact on care access, and addressing accountability. Addressing these gaps can inform normative analysis and guide the development of ethical guidelines for responsible CAI use in mental health care.",

        "abstract": "Background In the U.S., Black adults do not achieve the same life expectancy as their White counterparts, and this is attributable in large part to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mind–body therapy (MBT) interventions demonstrate improvements in cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors that promote CVD, with increased feasibility and acceptability in the general population. Less known is the feasibility, acceptability, and evidence of reduction in CMR factors in the U.S. Black population with MBT. Purpose This study aimed to synthesize the current state of research regarding MBT on CMR factors in middle-aged U.S. Black adults and identify gaps in the literature. Research Question 1: What types of studies have been conducted (study design, theoretical framework, and cultural relevance)? and Research Question 2: What is the feasibility and acceptability and effectiveness of MBT in Black adults for CMR reduction? Methods Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a review of three databases was conducted. Our inclusion criteria were articles that (1) describe empirical research; (2) assessed a MBT intervention in middle-aged (35–64) adults with a minimum of 60% Black adult participants for CMR reduction; and (3) written in English. Independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and data extraction, with a third reviewer providing consensus. Results Fourteen articles met the eligibility criteria (n = 14). Characteristics included randomized controlled trials (8, 57.1%); single-arm (3, 21.0%); mixed methods (3, 21.0%); sample size (17–375); mean age range 43–64; female (6, 42.8%); theoretical framework (4, 28.6%); culturally adapted (7, 50.0%); and studies demonstrating feasibility and/or acceptability (7, 50.0%). Of the seven articles assessing CMR physiologic factors, five studies observed significant improvement. For the 11 studies assessing CMR psychological factors, 6 studies had statistically significant results and 3 studies identified trends toward positive statistical outcomes. Implication A growing body of literature across research stages demonstrating acceptability, and feasibility, and evidence of effectiveness for selected outcomes of MBT in middle-aged Black adults with CMR factors shows promise. Future research recommendations include greater recruitment of Black men for MBT studies, larger sample sizes, and utilizing culturally adapted interventions for engaging Black adults in MBT for reduced CMR factors.",

        "title": "Expanding access to NCD services via community retail pharmacies in LMICs: a systematic review of the literature",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a significant global health challenge. In LMICs, NCDs are an incresing driver of premature deaths and have substantial economic impacts, particularly on working-age adults. The World Health Organization has identified four priority NCDs – cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer – which are included in its Package of Essential Non-Communicable Disease Interventions for low-resource primary care settings. However, a shortage of healthcare professionals further compounds the problem. Pharmacists, who could play a pivotal role in NCD care, remain underutilised. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies on the role of community pharmacies and pharmacists in delivering NCD services in low- and middle-income settings and assessed their risk of bias. Searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL from 1990 to 2022, including English, French, or Spanish publications. Results Out of 1,284 articles, 23 met inclusion criteria, predominantly focusing on diabetes (65%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (22%), cancer (9%), and asthma (4%). Most studies were conducted in Asia (52%), followed by South America (22%) and Africa (13%). Significant improvements were observed in glycaemic control and medication adherence for diabetes, and in blood pressure management and adherence for hypertension. Positive outcomes were also seen in health behaviours for breast cancer, asthma, and cardiovascular disease risk management. Interventions were cost-effective for managing diabetes and hypertension in elderly patients. However, accessibility challenges were noted in vaccination programmes, and concerns about bias were identified, particularly in observational studies. Conclusions Expanding NCD services through community pharmacies in low and middle-income countries can significantly improve health outcomes. Pharmacists can enhance education, screening, and management for NCDs, leading to better disease control and patient satisfaction. Addressing resource constraints, legal barriers, and disease focus disparities is essential. Adequate training, financial incentives, and collaboration among stakeholders are crucial for integrating pharmacists into NCD care frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Performance invalidity is under-studied in countries outside of the United States of America (US), with non-English examinees and with those who have low levels or poor quality of education.Method: This cross-cultural neuropsychological study explored performance invalidity in South African adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) litigants (N = 100) who had 7‒12 years of poor quality of education and who spoke Afrikaans (n = 35), English (n = 9) or one of the indigenous African languages of Xhosa (n = 52), Swahili (n = 1), Pedi (n = 1), Sotho (n = 1) and Chichewa (n = 1) as first languages.Results: Using demographically appropriate cutoff scores for seven performance validity tests (PVTs), the prevalence of performance invalidity was calculated as being close to 30% for this group. Participants who failed zero or one PVT were categorized as performing validly, while those who failed ≥ 2 PVTs were categorized as performing invalidly, raising suspicion of feigned cognitive impairment. Only 9% of the participants failed three or more PVTs. Severity of brain injury and the demographic factors of age and level of education did not play a significant role in PVT failure.Conclusion: Considering the prevalence rate and that South African psychologists now have access to PVTs with demographically appropriated cutoff scores, South African psychologists no longer have an excuse not to include PVTs in their test batteries, even with examinees who have severe TBI.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Health inequities may be driven by demographics such as sex, language proficiency, and race-ethnicity. These disparities may manifest through likelihood of testing, which in turn can bias artificial intelligence models. The goal of this study is to evaluate variation in serum lactate measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Methods: Utilizing MIMIC-IV (2008–2019), we identified adults fulfilling sepsis-3 criteria. Exclusion criteria were ICU stay <1-day, unknown race-ethnicity, <18 years of age, and recurrent stays. Employing targeted maximum likelihood estimation analysis, we assessed the likelihood of a lactate measurement on day 1. For patients with a measurement on day 1, we evaluated the predictors of subsequent readings. Results: We studied 15,601 patients (19.5% racial-ethnic minority, 42.4% female, and 10.0% limited English proficiency). After adjusting for confounders, Black patients had a slightly higher likelihood of receiving a lactate measurement on day 1 (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.34), but not the other minority groups. Subsequent frequency was similar across race-ethnicities, but women had a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.98). Interestingly, patients with elective admission and private insurance also had a higher frequency of repeated serum lactate measurements (IRR 1.70, 95% CI 1.61–1.81, and 1.07, 95% CI, 1.02–1.12, respectively). Conclusion: We found no disparities in the likelihood of a lactate measurement among patients with sepsis across demographics, except for a small increase for Black patients, and a reduced frequency for women. Variation in biomarker monitoring can be a source of data bias when modeling patient outcomes, and thus should be accounted for in every analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The rate of patients who leave without being seen (LWBS) from an emergency department (ED) is a common measurement of quality, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. We hypothesized that adding a nonclinical staff role, guest service ambassadors (GSA), to the ED waiting room would decrease LWBS rates and reduce existing differences by race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language for ED patients. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study at a quaternary care academic ED in the Midwestern United States with approximately 60,000 annual visits between April and December 2022. GSAs were trained to guide patients and visitors through the check‐in process and help manage the waiting room. LWBS rates were compared between pre‐ and postimplementation periods using logistic regression. Using two‐sample proportion tests, subgroup analyses were performed to assess differences according to race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language. Results We analyzed 50,507 ED visits including 9798 during periods of GSA coverage. GSA presence was associated with a reduction in LWBS rate from 3.4% to 2.0% (absolute risk reduction [ARR] of 1.4%, χ2 = 17.357, p < 0.001) with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.85). There was a greater reduction in LWBS for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) patients compared to White patients (BIPOC ARR 1.8%, 95% CI 0.39%–3.14%; White ARR 1.2%, 95% CI 0.48%–1.94%). There was a reduction in LBWS rates for both males and females (female ARR 1.7%, 95% CI 0.80%–2.63%; male ARR 1.0%, 95% CI 0.06%–1.90%). The reduction in LWBS for patients speaking a language other than English and requiring interpreter services did not meet statistical significance (ARR 1.4%, 95% CI −1.04% to 3.85%). Conclusions Although some disparities remain, our study suggests that GSAs may provide an effective strategy to reduce the overall LWBS rate and reduce disparities across diverse demographic groups including BIPOC and female patients.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is often associated with psychiatric conditions, notably anxiety and depression due to their poor visual function. Recognizing this relationship is important for healthcare professionals to holistically treat AMD patients potentially facing these psychiatric challenges.\n \n \n \n This study aims to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in AMD patients.\n \n \n \n A systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EMBASE. This review included English-language studies on anxiety or depression in AMD patients aged 18 years and above. Studies on other psychiatric disorders, review articles, or case reports were excluded. Gray literature from conference abstracts, theses, and dissertations was manually searched. The risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Data extraction focused on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0.\n \n \n \n Our search yielded 104 records, with 47 advancing to full-text review, resulting in the inclusion of 23 articles with 13,063 AMD patients. For depression, 18 studies were included, with significant heterogeneity between them (I\n 2 = 99.2%, P < 0.001). A random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird (D + L) method was applied, showing a pooled prevalence of depression of 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [15, 30]) among 12,444 AMD patients. Similarly, for anxiety, 17 studies were included, also showing a high level of heterogeneity (I\n 2 = 96.9%, P < 0.001). Using the same D + L random effects model, the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 14% (95% CI: [10, 17]) among 12,021 AMD patients.\n \n \n \n Healthcare providers and patients should be aware of the high prevalence of anxiety (14%) and depression (22%) in AMD and consider the possibility of routine mental health screening and appropriate management.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social determinants of health (SDoH) are environmental and socioeconomic factors that indirectly or directly influence health. This study examined whether SDoH that might relate to health literacy or access to health care are associated with lifetime history of parent-reported concussion in school-aged children and adolescents in the United States. We hypothesized that lower parental education, living in poverty, and speaking a language other than English as the primary language in the home would be associated with a lower lifetime history of concussion. Participants were parents or caregivers of 34,077 children and adolescents (ages 5–17) from the 2021 National Survey of Children’s Health. SDoH variables included primary language spoken at home, family income, parental level of education, and current health insurance. Univariable analyses assessed the individual association of each SDoH variable with lifetime history of concussion. A multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the combined association of SDoH variables and other demographic predictors with lifetime concussion history. In the univariable models, male gender, older age, sports participation, and having current health care coverage were associated with a higher lifetime history of concussion. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, primary language spoken at home other than English, lower level of parental education, living in poverty, and Black or Asian race were associated with lower lifetime history of concussion. In a multivariable model, significant independent predictors of lower lifetime concussion history were lower level of parental education, not speaking English as the primary language at home, and identifying as Black or Asian. It is possible that lower parental education, living in poverty, and speaking a language other than English as the primary language spoken are factors relating to lower concussion-related health literacy. Lower health literacy might contribute to families being less likely to (i) recognize the symptoms of concussion and (ii) seek medical evaluation for the injury.",

        "abstract": "Background: Research shows that media-based dietary and behavioral strategies can aid weight loss, but limited studies have been conducted among Black/African American adults. Objective: This review examines the literature on dietary and behavioral strategies for weight loss and maintenance among Black/African American adults, identifying the types of media used alongside these strategies. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Communication & Mass Media databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with no restrictions on the publication date. Two reviewers conducted the screening. Studies were included if they had >75% Black/African American adult participants (18 years and older), included behavioral or dietary strategies, had a media component, weight loss or maintenance as an outcome, and published in English language. Results: Nine studies (randomized control trials (n = 5), mixed-method studies (n = 2) and qualitative studies (n = 2)) were included. Behavioral strategies used to lose and maintain weight included goal setting (n = 4), self-monitoring (n = 5), and weekly self-weighing (n = 2). Limiting sugary drinks (n = 3), limiting junk and high fat foods (n = 5), aiming for a set number of calories per day (n = 3), portion control (n = 4), and increasing fruits and vegetable intake (n = 3) were the most common dietary strategies used to lose and maintain weight. Media used in the intervention studies included mHealth text messaging (n = 2), Facebook (n = 2), a website (n = 1), television (n = 1) and a mobile app (n = 1). Conclusions: The findings highlight the limited research on the utilization of media for behavioral and dietary weight loss strategies among Black/African American adults, indicating a need for future studies to explore and optimize media-based strategies for this population.",

        "abstract": "Background: The most effective treatment approach for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain in spondyloarthropathy (SpA) patients remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of different injective therapies for SIJ pain in SpA patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to January 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies in English, including comparative and non-comparative studies, and case series. A meta-analysis was performed on the available data. The “Checklist for Measuring Quality” by Downs and Black was used to evaluate the quality of included papers. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 494 patients were included: 12 prospective case series, 1 retrospective comparative study, 2 prospective comparative studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials. Steroid injections were analyzed in 15 studies, etanercept in 1, and infliximab in 1. A meta-analysis of 375 patients receiving steroid injections showed a significant reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) scores from 8.2 pre-treatment to 3.2 (p < 0.001) at short-term follow-up, with stability at mid-term follow-up (VAS 3.3, p < 0.001) and worsening at the last follow-up (VAS 5.1, p < 0.001). The failure rate was 13% (p = 0.019), and one study reported a 12.5% complication rate. Biologic therapies showed no complications or failures, with improvements in both VAS and BASDAI scores. Conclusions: Intra-articular steroid injections are effective and safe for SIJ pain in SpA patients, although their efficacy diminishes over time, and not all patients respond to treatment. Biologic therapies have shown promising results, but further research is needed to confirm their long-term efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. Although physical exercise (PE) has emerged in the literature as an important modulator for reducing such risk, evidence remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of PE on cardiometabolic health in individuals with ASD. Methods: A systematic review was carried out according to the PRISMA guidelines, from their inception until 18 July 2023, in the following electronic databases: Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they focused on ASD patients undergoing physical exercise, assessing cardiometabolic risk, exercise tolerance, and QoL. The following were excluded: non-exercise interventions, additional therapies, non-English studies, and reviews. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed through the Downs and Black scale. Results: A total of four studies (149 participants) were included in this review, with the average methodological quality being rated as “fair”. Interventions had mixed effects on cardiometabolic health. The BMI (↓2.8 kg/m2), waist circumference (↓1.86 cm), and lipid profiles improved in some cases. VO2max and HRbaseline showed moderate gains. Secondary outcomes included enhanced endurance, strength, and calorie expenditure, especially in mild ASD. Autistic traits and quality of life improved post-intervention, with better results in the experimental groups. Conclusions: This review indicates that aerobic and functional training improves cardiometabolic health, autistic traits, and QoL in individuals with ASD, particularly in mild cases. Further research is needed to explore the impact of ASD severity on these outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background Socio-economic inequalities significantly impact paediatric cancer survival. The review aims to elucidate the facilitators and barriers influencing the availability and accessibility of essential medicines for childhood cancer (EMCC) in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). Methods This systematic review was conducted adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Peer- reviewed primary studies, national/regional reports, and policy documents published in the English language were included through a thorough literature search using three electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Review questions were framed according to the ECLIPS framework. Children under 19 years of age living in LLMICs diagnosed with any malignancy were the client group. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the mixed methods appraisal tool. Data is presented as a narrative synthesis. Enablers and barriers were discussed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) health system building blocks. Results Out of the 29 articles retrieved for full-text screening, the final synthesis included nine articles. Six were based on quantitative, two on mixed-method research, and one was a review article. These studies represented 26 LLMICs from several continents (Africa, Asia, and America). The alignment of the National Essential Medicine Lists (NEMLs) with the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List for Children (WHO EMC) varied from 40%- 60%. Overall stock out rate ranged from 17 to 100%. Stock out rate was higher in the public sector than in the private sector. International partnerships, policy changes, and financing strategies are some of the key enablers identified. Barriers included inadequate global drug production, high drug costs, weak regulatory enforcement, poor supply chain management, and insufficient health information systems. Conclusion The findings of our review revealed the failure of LLMICs to meet the WHO- recommended target of 80% availability for EMCCs. The availability and accessibility of EMCC in LLMICs are hindered by multiple systemic barriers despite several enabling strategies. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated global efforts and local initiatives to ensure equitable access to childhood cancer treatments in LLMICs. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022334156.

        "abstract": "Background: Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is increasing in the United States. The main objective of this study is to test the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to develop models for predicting SMM during delivery hospitalizations in Maryland. Secondarily, we examine disparities in SMM by key sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: We used the linked State Inpatient Database (SID) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey data from Maryland for 2016–2019 (N = 261,226 delivery hospitalizations). We first estimated relative risks for SMM across key sociodemographic factors (e.g., race, income, insurance, and primary language). Then, we fitted LASSO and, for comparison, Logit models with 75 and 18 features. The selection of SMM features was based on clinical expert opinion, a literature review, statistical significance, and computational resource constraints. Various model performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and recall values were computed to compare predictive performance. Results: During 2016–2019, 76 per 10,000 deliveries (1976 of 261,226) were in patients who experienced an SMM event. The Logit model with a full list of 75 features achieved an AUC of 0.71 in the validation dataset, which marginally decreased to 0.69 in the reduced model with 18 features. The LASSO algorithm with the same 18 features demonstrated slightly superior predictive performance and an AUC of 0.80. We found significant disparities in SMM among patients living in low-income areas, with public insurance, and who were non-Hispanic Black or non-English speakers. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing ML and administrative hospital discharge data for SMM prediction. The low recall score is a limitation across all models we compared, signifying that the algorithms struggle with identifying all SMM cases. This study identified substantial disparities in SMM across various sociodemographic factors. Addressing these disparities requires multifaceted interventions that include improving access to quality care, enhancing cultural competence among healthcare providers, and implementing policies that help mitigate social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Norovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. Individuals of all ages are susceptible to NoV, but young children and older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes, including death. Due to the challenges the genomic diversity of NoV presents for vaccine development, it is important to understand global patterns of genotype diversity in these populations with highest need.Figure 1. Genotype prevalence by year among global norovirus AGE cases in children < 18 years, 2002 to 2021 Years refer to the first year of each season; e.g. “2002” represents the 2002-2003 season. SUM GII.4 includes GII.4 Hong Kong, GII.4 Sydney, GII.4 Den Haag, GII.4 New Orleans, and Other/Unknown GII.4. Methods A targeted review was conducted in PubMed of English language studies from 2002-2022 that reported NoV genotype prevalence in children < 18 and adults ≥ 60. Studies were included that reported individual, genotyped cases (not outbreaks) with AGE symptoms. Prevalence of each genotype was estimated by season and geographic region by summing individual cases for each genotype across included studies.Figure 2. Genotype prevalence among global norovirus AGE cases in adults ≥ 60 years, 2010-2017 (n=176) Stratified analysis by season was not possible due to small sample size (N<20 cases for multiple years). SUM GII.4 includes GII.4 Hong Kong, GII.4 Sydney, GII.4 Den Haag, GII.4 New Orleans, and Other/Unknown GII.4. Results A total of 7,718 pediatric and 176 adult cases were included in the analysis, from 37 studies including children and 5 including older adults. In both children and adults, GII.4 was most prevalent across all years combined (55% and 84% of cases, respectively) (Figs. 1, 2). Among children, GII.3 was next most prevalent (18%), followed by GII.2 (10%); the most common GI genotype was GI.3 (2% of cases). In recent seasons (2018/19-2021/22), GII.4 prevalence ranged from 41% to 59%. In adults, analysis by year and region was limited by sample size. Overall, after GII.4, GII.2 was most prevalent (10% of cases), and GI genotypes were uncommon (< 1%) (Fig. 2). When pediatric cases were analyzed by region, GII.4 was most prevalent across region, but greater diversity in non-GII.4 cases was seen in Africa and Central/South America (Fig. 3). Genotype prevalence was similar for adults across regions where data were available (Fig. 4).Figure 3. Genotype prevalence among norovirus AGE cases in children < 18 years by geographic region, 2002-2021 Conclusion Analysis of genotyped symptomatic NoV AGE cases worldwide over two decades showed similar patterns in children and older adults over time, with consistent predominance of GII.4 in both age groups and across geographies, and greater diversity in children and in Africa and Central/South America among non-GII.4 cases. Data from adult populations were limited despite established disease burden in this age group. Contemporary data on circulating NoV genotypes will be needed for vaccine development, particularly among adults where data are scarce.Figure 4.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a parasitic disease of the CNS caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, and is the leading cause of acquired seizure disorder worldwide. This study is the first to explore the clinical characteristics and courses of NCC patients in Florida.Figure 1: Countries of Origin 76% of patients reported a country of origin outside of the United States (Mexico, 12; Guatemala, 4; Haiti, Nepal, El Salvador, 2; Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Mozambique, Nepal, Peru, 1) The remainder of patients did not specify a country of origin. Methods The inclusion criteria for this retrospective chart review included any patient presenting to UF Health Shands Hospital, Gainesville, FL, with symptomatic NCC diagnosed between June 1993-June 2023 given an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code of NCC confirmed by imaging, serology, or biopsy.Table 1: Epidemiological Characteristics of NCC Patients Selected epidemiological characteristics of 34 identified patients represented as percentages. Results 34 patients met inclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics of these patients included country of origin (76% non-USA, 24% unspecified), sex (59% Male, 41% Female), ethnicity (65% Hispanic, 32% non-Hispanic, 3% unspecified), age (68% 21-50, 18% 51-70, 15% 0-20), race (47% white, 12% black/AA, 9% Asian, 3% AIAAN, 29% unspecified), insurance status (41% uninsured, 21% insured, 38% unspecified), language preferred for medical correspondence (47% Spanish, 38% English, 6% other, 9% unspecified), and per capita income of Florida county of origin (53% bottom 50%, 41% top 50%, 6% unspecified). Select pre-, intra-, post-hospitalization features and outcomes were recorded. 52% of patients' cysts were staged. Symptoms at time of presentation included headaches (25%), seizures (20%), systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, malaise) (15%), and CNS deficits (10%). 97% of patients reported NCC symptoms prior to receiving an NCC diagnosis and 72% of patients presented to at least one healthcare facility for similar symptoms without receiving a diagnosis of NCC. Out of the 52% who were staged, 56% received incorrect medical management; these patients either received medications for inactive infection (18%) or did not receive proper medication for active infection (38%). 21% of patients were readmitted at least once for NCC symptoms or complications. 18% of patients stayed in the hospital for more than 10 days.Figure 2: Symptoms Prior to Presentation Symptoms patients reported experiencing prior to the time of their diagnostic presentation. Conclusion This research identifies a unique population of patients burdened by NCC and characterizes delays in patient presentation and diagnosis. This may aid clinicians in identifying common patient presentations associated with NCC to promote prompt and accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and close follow-up.Table 2: NCC Cyst Staging Cyst staging was performed for 53% of patients (18 in total); 27 cysts in total were staged representing multiple patients with more than one visible NCC cyst that was staged.

        "title": "P-2184. Antiviral Use among Immigrants with Chronic Hepatitis B (HBV) in Metropolitan-DC",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Globally, 296 million people are infected with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the Metropolitan-DC area, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) is 10 times more common in Asian, African, and Latin American communities (5% prevalence) than non-immigrants communities. Therefore, HBV-related liver disease, including cancer, is a major health disparity for immigrants. Antivirals reduce cancer risk but require long-term adherence. Immigrants face barriers to HBV antiviral adherence, including language, high cost of antivirals, and establishing care for HBV management. We examine antiviral use in a cohort of people with HBV. Methods HOPE is a natural history study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. HOPE enrolls adults with HBV and includes TEMUL, a sub-study providing free tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for 2 years. After completing 2 years of TEMUL, participants are transitioned to receiving antivirals through their non-study healthcare providers. We describe antiviral use while on TEMUL and at a 2-year follow-up. Results From May 2017 to March 2024, 92 people received TAF through TEMUL. Eighty-four were foreign-born (78 born in Asia and 6 born in Africa). Most (67%) had mild liver fibrosis at baseline. Eleven were withdrawn (3 lost to follow-up, 3 moved out of state, 5 voluntarily withdrew). Eighty-one completed TEMUL with sustained adherence to TAF. Fifty-eight completed a 2-year follow-up. At follow-up, 36 of 58 (62%) remained on TAF without interruption. Twelve (21%) switched antivirals because of insurance coverage. This caused lapses in antiviral use ranging from 1 month to 2 years in 5 (9%). Ten (17%) stopped antivirals due to loss of health insurance, high copay, and inability to follow-up with a healthcare provider. All 10 were foreign-born, Asian, and non-English speaking. Of these 10, 9 were viremic at follow-up and resumption of antivirals was clinically indicated in all. Conclusion Language and inadequate health insurance coverage hinder antiviral adherence in immigrants with HBV. Foreign-born, non-English speaking patients may be especially vulnerable to lapses in antiviral use. Interventions to improve access to antivirals tailored to this patient group are needed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Antibiotic use without a prescription (non-prescription use) is a highly prevalent issue that poses significant individual and population level risk. We designed a patient-focused educational brochure to reduce non-prescription antibiotic use and report patient survey results about the brochure’s acceptability, appropriateness, and usability.Figure 1. Brochure Usability, Appropriateness, and Acceptability For the three criteria of usability, appropriateness, and acceptability, responses of \"completely agree\" and \"agree\" were categorized as positive while \"neither agree or disagree,\" \"disagree,\" or \"completely disagree\" were categorized as negative responses. n = 100 respondents. Methods The brochure was developed with input from six racially/ethnically diverse community advisory board members plus 2 experts in health literacy and cultural competency in Hispanic communities. Brochure content included information on safe means of obtaining antibiotics, antibiotic side effects, non-antibiotic treatment of common symptoms, and how to access care at the public clinics. From October 2023 to February 2024, brochures (in English or Spanish) were distributed to 100 patients at two local clinics (50 each). Patients completed a survey about the brochure acceptability, appropriateness, and usability, followed by an open-ended question about suggestions for improvement. Results Survey participants were on average 53 years old, 72% female, 72% college educated, and primarily Black (35%), Hispanic or Latino (30%), or Caucasian (28%). 81% had adequate health literacy. Respondents largely found the brochure acceptable (98%), appropriate (98%), and usable (100%). 96% of respondents said the brochure was useful, referencing learning about antibiotic indications (23%), over the counter alternatives for symptom relief (23%), and antibiotic side effects (14%). The most common reason respondents did not find the brochure useful was they already “knew everything in [the] brochure” (n = 4). 15 respondents (15%) had suggestions for improvement such as having an alternative media form (e.g., an audio version) and having the brochure available at the pharmacy (27% each). Conclusion We designed a brochure about antibiotic safety that was considered acceptable, appropriate, and usable by our diverse clinic patients. Key learning points reported by patients included antibiotic indications, side effects, and over the counter alternatives. Next the brochure will be the focus of an intervention to reduce non-prescription antibiotic use among our socially vulnerable patient population.

        "title": "P-1404. Trends and Disparities in Viral Load Suppression Among People Living with HIV in Three Texas Cities: A Decade-Long Retrospective Study",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV/AIDS remains a significant public health challenge in the United States, especially in states with diverse populations such as Texas. This study examines viral load trends among people living with HIV in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio over ten years. The aim is to investigate variations in viral load suppression among individuals living with HIV across different cities, considering demographic variables like age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on people with HIV (PWH) from 2009 to 2019. Demographic data, clinical variables, and viral suppression status were analyzed across different groups using time-to-event analysis. Results The analysis revealed that being female was linked to a reduced hazard ratio for detectable viral load (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 - 0., p = 0.005) after adjusting for other demographic factors (table 2). Additionally, younger age groups (18-29, 30-39, and 40-49) exhibited significantly higher hazard ratios compared to those aged 50 and above, indicating a higher risk of detectable viral load. Race/ethnicity emerged as a significant factor, with Non-Hispanic Black individuals displaying a higher hazard ratio compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.48, p < 0.001). Furthermore, Medicaid-insured individuals demonstrated higher risk of detectable viral load, consistent with both univariate and multivariate analyses. However, language preference did not significantly influence viral load detection status, as evidenced by the absence of a significant difference between English and Spanish speakers in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion Our research investigates disparities in achieving viral load suppression among individuals with HIV in Texas. Younger people seem to encounter challenges in maintaining viral suppression compared to older age groups. The influence of social determinants of health is highlighted by racial/ethnic disparities. While our study did not find a significant impact of language barriers on viral load detection, further exploration is needed to better comprehend these results. Disclosures Karen J.

        "abstract": "Objectives This study examines the associations between race and ethnicity and receipt of Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) key clinical practices that support breastfeeding in US hospitals. Methods National data from 2016 to 2019 CDC PRAMS were analyzed. Our sample included 60,395 mothers who initiated breastfeeding with healthy, term newborns. We conducted adjusted regression analyses to compare the odds of receiving individual key clinical practices that support breastfeeding, as well as the percent of key clinical practices received. Results While some key clinical practices were received at high rates, less than 25% of mothers received 100% of recommended key clinical practices. Compared to White non-Hispanic mothers, mothers from various racial and ethnic groups were at lower odds of receiving 100% of key clinical practices: Black non-Hispanic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.47–0.65)], English-Speaking Hispanic [AOR 0.79, 95% CI (0.71–0.88)], Spanish-speaking Hispanic [AOR 0.63, 95% CI (0.53–0.73)], and Asian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic [AOR 0.54, 95% CI (0.47–0.63)]. Conclusions for Practice Despite a steady increase in the number of BFHI hospitals in the US, there are racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of BFHI key clinical practices. More US hospitals must adopt BFHI key clinical practices and consistently implement those practices for every racial and ethnic group.

        "abstract": "The paper examines the entries of 36 words for common animal sounds in two online English dictionaries, Cambridge Dictionaries and The Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, to see what information is provided in the entries. Previous work on English dictionaries has focused on meaning explanations of referential, arbitrary words. With the examination of onomatopoeic words for animal sounds, this paper expands the field beyond the study of arbitrary words and into words whose forms contribute to their meaning.\nThe results show that there are no consistent policies for how words for animal sounds are handled, or how the animal readings are separated from other possible meanings of the words. There is variation in how explicitly the animals are mentioned in the definitions of meaning, and if they are in fact mentioned at all. The entries for the verb and noun uses of the words may not contain the same information. The examples, in cases where the animal readings are exemplified at all, may come in a different entry from where the relevant definition of meaning is provided. One of the dictionaries also relies heavily on definitions where the word’s meaning is explained in terms of itself. The use of synonyms in the meaning explanations of onomatopoeic words is also found to be problematic. As these words do not merely identify a referent, but describe or imitate what the referent sounds like, exchanging one word for another does not carry over the same imagery of sound.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients need to be supported in combining treatment with daily life. However, measurement of supportive care indicators related to treatment-related side effects is under-reported. This review aimed to identify a list of quality indicators for managing cancer treatment-induced toxicities for adult patients with cancer. Methods A review was conducted on PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase from September 26, 2013 to December 26, 2023. Published English articles that developed or analyzed quality indicators of managing cancer treatment-induced toxicities for adult patients with cancer were selected. The identified indicators were classified according to Donabedian’s model for quality of care in healthcare. Results Forty-two indicators (4 structural, 27 process, and 11 outcome indicators) in 18 articles were identified. Eight articles (44.4%) were from North America, four (22.2%) from Europe, two (11.1%) from Oceania, two (11.1%) from Asia, and one (5.6%) from Africa; 64.3% of the indicators were process indicators based on guidelines. The prevalence of patient symptoms determined using a patient-reported outcome measure was proposed as an outcome indicator. In seven studies (38.9%), these indicators were selected by multidisciplinary experts. None of the studies involved patients or family members in the indicator selection process. Conclusion The quality of supportive care should be improved by measuring these indicators, considering the patient’s needs for supportive care at each hospital such that patients can continue their lives while undergoing treatment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWith 8.4% of Americans uninsured, free clinics serve as essential safety nets for underserved populations. This study compared the demographics of the patients of a student-run free to Toledo, Ohio, and national census data to evaluate health needs, barriers to care, and the characteristics of the underserved population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of 1,338 visits across five clinic sites was conducted from February 2023 to February 2024. Demographic variables, including race, insurance, education, sex, and primary language, were analyzed and compared to 2020 Census data from Toledo, Ohio, and the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to Toledo, the clinic served 22.63% fewer White patients, 17.27% more Hispanic/Latino patients, and 5.62% fewer African American patients. Among clinic patients under 65 years, 61.91% were uninsured, compared to 8.3% in Toledo and 10.2% nationally. Non-English speakers were overrepresented (33.4% vs. 6.8% in Toledo and 9.5% nationally), with Spanish speakers making up 21.72% of clinic patients compared to 3.2% in Toledo. Educational attainment differed slightly, with fewer high school graduates (82.97% vs. 87.10% in Toledo) but more individuals with higher education degrees (27.10% vs. 19.6% in Toledo and 25.6% nationally).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study underscores the demographic differences between CCC patients and city, state, and national populations, offering insight into the populations most reliant on free clinics. Policymakers and public health agencies must consider these disparities to tailor interventions addressing healthcare access and social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Background: The use of condoms is the only method of contraception that can protect a person from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This study aims to analyze and estimate the effect of gender, marital status and residence on condom use among adults. \nSubject and Method: The systematic review and meta-analysis studies were conducted according to the PRISMA flowchart and PICO model. Population: Adults in general. Intervention: Gender (Female), Place of Residence (Rural) and Marital Status (Unmarried) in using condoms. Comparison: gender (male), place of residence (urban), and marital status (married). Outcome: condom use. The basic data used involves Google Scholar, PubMed, BMC, Scient Direct, and Springer Link with the keywords (“Use condom”) AND (“Gender”) AND (“Marital status”) AND (“Adult”) AND (“Cross -sectional”). Inclusion criteria were cross-sectional study articles in English published from 2014 to 2024. Data analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.3 application. \nResult: This meta-analysis included 14 cross-sectional studies from Ethiopia, Iran, Africa, and America. The sample size in this meta-analysis was 18,322. Meta-analysis showed that condom use was less in women (aOR= 0.66; 95% CI= 1.20 to 0.36; p 0.170), and more in rural areas (aOR= 0.80; 95% CI= 0.66 to 0.98; p= 0.620), with unmarried status (aOR = 0.92 CI 95%= 1.97 to 0.43; p 0.830). However, these three results were not statistically significant. \nConclusion: Condom use is less among women and more in rural areas with unmarried status.",

        "abstract": "Given Ghana’s position as first independent nation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah made a conscious effort to project the nation as an example of what Black Africa could accomplish, through largescale architectural projects. He took up the decision to build a new harbour together with a new town, Tema, as part of the Volta River Dam Project. In 1960, he hired prominent Greek architect and planner, Costantinos Apostolou Doxiadis, who radically revised what had been an earlier English plan. The current study investigates the role of Doxiadis in the development of Tema. It argues that his role transcended the provision of a master plan for Tema and involved several services to the government that went over and above that of a traditional planner. Using archival research, observations, interviews, and urban plan analyses, this study demonstrates not only how his ideas were implemented on the ground (Community 4), but also how these impacted developments that took place after the phase that involved his active participation. As the study shows by means of satellite imagery analysis, later and current community developments - undertaken by indigenous planners deviated - from the strict Ekistics approach that was adopted in the early stages.",

        "abstract": "Many online health information sources are generic and difficult to understand, but consumers want information to be personalized and understandable. Smartphone health applications (apps) offer personalized information to support health goals and reduce preventable chronic conditions. This study aimed to determine how the HealthyMe/MiSalud personalized app (1) engaged English-speaking African American and Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults, and (2) motivated them to set goals and follow preventive recommendations. Our study adds to the literature on digital health, health information seeking, and prevention. We used a multi-method approach, including community and participatory design principles, to learn about potential African American and Hispanic adult health app users and evaluate the app in two usability tests and a 12-month field test. Ninety-six African American and Hispanic adults downloaded the HealthyMe/MiSalud app and used it for a minimum of 36 weeks. We found they wanted personalized information on core prevention topics, and their health histories and goals affected how they rated topic relevance. African American females ages 18-34 were more likely to save an article aligned with family health history, and African American females aged 35-49, males age 50-64, and African American males overall were more likely to save an article aligned with their health goals. Our study revealed that a prevention app with personalized recommendations can support health information seeking and health literacy. These findings can help app developers, public health practitioners, and researchers when designing apps for groups of varying identities.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Lichen planopilaris (LPP) and frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) are primary scarring alopecias that few authors consider the same entity, and some consider them different. Only a few reviews focus on trichoscopic findings in delineating these two alopecias. Objective We describe and summarize the trichoscopic features of both conditions. Methods We performed an extensive literature search using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The Chi-square test was applied to compare the trichoscopic features in LPP and FFA. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Out of 60 articles, 33 (16 LPP, 17 FFA) were considered for quantitative analysis due to availability in English literature with full text. We found that peripilar cylindrical casts and perifollicular erythema with arborizing vessels were predominant features suggesting early LPP. In contrast, yellow dots, perifollicular erythema, and scattered pigmentation suggested active FFA. Shiny-white area was seen in both groups in the inactive stages. The target arrangement of blue-grey dots, milky-red areas, and irregularly arranged white fibrotic dots were seen in late LPP, and black dots, lonely hairs, and loss of vellus hairs were detected in the later stages of FFA. Features such as blue-grey structureless areas, blue-white veil, and variability in morphologies of hair shafts were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion This article provides a comprehensive literature review on the trichoscopic features of LPP and FFA, including comparing the similarities, differences, and peculiarities of both conditions.",

        "abstract": "Objective  Congenital heart disease (CHD) is an important contributor to pediatric morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD exist across racial and ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to share the experiences of Hispanic and Black families with CHD to better understand their needs. Study Design  This was a descriptive qualitative study involving two 2-part focus groups, one conducted in English and one in Spanish, consisting of parents of infants with CHD. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via a conventional content analysis approach. Results  Six family members participated, representing a range of cardiac diagnoses. Two participants cited their identity as non-Hispanic Black and four as Hispanic. Three organizing themes emerged related to (1) communication, (2) psychosocial needs and processing, and (3) practical challenges associated with having a child with CHD. Together, these organizing themes supported a singular global theme: structural and socioemotional gaps in care exist for families of infants with CHD that need to be met in order to optimize care for patients and families. Conclusion  Societal and systems-level factors, including structural inequities, contribute to the care gaps experienced by racial and ethnic minority families of children with CHD. Key Points Poor communication around CHD diagnosis impairs provider–patient trust. Language barriers hinder accurate communication about CHD diagnosis and treatment. Parents of children with CHD have unmet mental health needs. Perinatal providers should champion health equity for CHD patients and their families.",

        "abstract": "Background/aims To examine the association between sociodemographic characteristics and attendance at Hospital Eye Service (HES) referrals from the Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP), in a large, ethnically diverse urban population. Methods Retrospective cohort study (4 January 2016–12 August 2019) of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) referred from an English DESP to a tertiary referral eye hospital. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression with attendance as the primary outcome, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation, best eye visual acuity and baseline DR grade. Results Of 7793 people referred (mean age 64 years, 62.6% male, 13.9% white, 12.5% black, 25.3% South Asian, 6.5% any other Asian background, 19.3% no recorded ethnicity and 20.9% of ‘Other’ ethnic origin), 69% attended. Compared with white individuals, people of black ethnic origin were similarly likely to attend. South Asians and those of other Asian backgrounds were more likely, and people with ‘Other’ or missing ethnicity were less likely to attend. Those with higher levels of deprivation, younger (aged 18–45 years) and older (76–90 years) age groups and worse visual acuity were less likely to attend, whereas people identified as having proliferative DR in both eyes were more likely to attend. Conclusion Sociodemographic patterns in attendance after referral from the DESP to the HES exist, and these do not appear to explain ethnic differences in more severe sight-threatening DR, suggesting other explanations. More work is needed to understand and reduce inequalities in HES attendance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social psychological research on race and racism has shown that claims about racism are not always accepted or received as valid reports. In this paper, I offer racial epistemics as one mechanism by which race‐talk takes place. I examine how ascribing category‐bound entitlements to experiential or other knowledge about racism is variously realised and complicated in the production of claims about racism. Through examining news media accounts where Black persons were invited to talk about their experiences of racism in India, I show that despite ascribing a privileged epistemic position to Black persons, recipients (interviewers and other panellists) could make salient epistemic entitlements to commonsense, specialised, or other forms of (racial) knowledge in collaboratively establishing, confirming or correcting, and challenging claims about racism in India. The findings are discussed in relation to the broader understanding of racism in social psychology. The data are in Indian English.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common diabetes complication and a leading cause of blindness. Although bariatric surgery (BS) is well studied for diabetes management, its effects on DR onset and progression, particularly long-term outcomes, remain underexplored. This review seeks to evaluate the short- and long-term retinal outcomes of BS in diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, including the use of the PRISMA checklist and flow diagram. The search included English-language articles (2014–2024) using keywords like “diabetic retinopathy” and “bariatric surgery”. The review excluded studies published in languages other than English, as well as reviews, case reports, and those lacking adequate data or relevance. The risk of bias was determined by using the Downs and Black checklist. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, and the results were organized and displayed in tables to summarize and compare the main findings. Results: After screening 158 articles, 13 studies involving 17,903 patients were selected, focusing on the effects of BS on DR progression and regression. Short-term data suggest that BS may stabilize or improve DR but poses risks of worsening in advanced cases, requiring careful monitoring. However, long-term findings are inconsistent, with evidence of both DR regression and progression. These variations highlight the need for further research. Discussion: BS generally improves DR progression, but its effect depends on preoperative severity and glycemic control. Further studies should explore additional risk factors to better predict DR outcomes post-surgery. Conclusions: BS improves weight management, blood pressure, and diabetes control, potentially benefiting DR. However, the long-term effects remain uncertain due to conflicting findings. Rapid glycemic changes after surgery may pose risks of DR progression. Large-scale, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the role of BS in DR progression and regression.",

        "abstract": "Objective Studies in the USA examining the relationship between ethnicity and colorectal cancer (CRC) identified significant variation. This study sought to examine the relationship between ethnic group, route to diagnosis, early-onset CRC and stage at diagnosis in the English National Health Service. Methods Data from COloRECTal cancer data Repository for all individuals diagnosed with CRC (International Classification of Diseases version 10, C18–C20) between 2012 and 2017. A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the study population was performed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between ethnicity, route to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis and early-onset CRC. Results Early-onset CRC was least common in those in the white ethnic group (5.5% diagnosed <50, vs 17.9% in the Asian, 15.5% in the black and 21.8% in the mixed and multiple ethnic groups, p<0.01). Diagnosis following a 2-week wait referral was significantly less common among individuals from the Asian, black, other and unknown ethnic groups than the white ethnic group (Asian OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91, black OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93, other OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.90 and unknown OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.73). The Asian ethnic group had significantly lower odds of emergency diagnosis than the white ethnic group (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). Following adjustment, individuals from the Asian ethnic group were significantly less likely, than their white counterparts, to be diagnosed at stage IV (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88). Conclusion This study identified different demographic profiles of those diagnosed with CRC between broad ethnic groups, highlighting the need to consider access to diagnostic CRC services in the context of ethnicity.",

        "abstract": "Black tea, a popular beverage, is rich in polyphenols. However, thorough analyses of clinical trial evidence supporting its health benefits are lacking. This narrative review is aimed at addressing this knowledge gap by synthesizing findings across pivotal clinical domains and identifying critical areas for further investigation. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed for English-language papers from January 1990 to July 2024, focusing on cardiovascular and metabolic health, as well as cognitive function. Findings from clinical trials indicated that consuming black tea regularly enhances endothelial and vascular health, notably by improving flow-mediated vasodilation. These advantages are largely due to the tea's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota–modulating effects, including the promotion of beneficial bacterial species such as Flavonifractor plautii. Effects on metabolic health, such as lipid profiles and glucose metabolism, were inconsistent. However, black tea was linked to improved cognitive function, especially attention and alertness, likely due to caffeine and L-theanine. Despite these promising results, further research is needed to overcome limitations like small sample sizes and short study durations. Future studies should be aimed at standardizing black tea preparations to optimize health benefits.",

We aim to assess the impact of the unprecedented change in care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic on inequalities in adverse maternity outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study using structured electronic health record data. Setting English hospital trusts providing maternity care. Participants Women giving birth and babies born in the National Health Service (NHS) in England between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2021, in three time groups: prepandemic, the first pandemic wave (26 March 2020 to 30 June 2020) and second pandemic wave (1 July 2020 to 31 March 2021). Self-reported ethnicity was grouped into White, South-Asian, Black, Mixed and Other. Main outcome measures Composite and component measures of maternal (emergency caesarean section, obstetric anal sphincter injury, hysterectomy, sepsis, anaesthetic complications and prolonged hospital stay) and perinatal (stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, brain injury, small for gestational age and prolonged hospital stay). Poisson regression was used to compare relative risks between different ethnic groups. Findings 1.54 million maternal and 1.43 million neonatal records were included. The overall incidence of adverse outcomes per 1000 births initially decreased maternal: from 308.0 (95% CI 307.0 to 309.0) to 291.0 (95% CI 311.4 to 314.9) (p<0.001); perinatal: from 133.0 (95% CI 132.3 to 133.7) to 111.9 (95% CI 110.1 to 113.7) (p<0.001)), but then increased in the second pandemic period (maternal: 313.2 (95% CI 311.4 to 314.9) (p<0.001); perinatal 118.9 (95% CI 117.7 to 120.0) (p<0.001)). The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in women and babies from all ethnic minority groups compared with White women in both pandemic periods. Black and South-Asian women and babies were approximately 25% more likely to sustain adverse outcomes. While similar overall changes in adverse outcomes were seen in all groups, existing inequalities were sustained throughout the pandemic periods. Interpretation Existing inequalities in adverse maternal and perinatal/neonatal outcomes were maintained, not tempered, during the pandemic, despite substantial changes to maternity services and care. Further research on possible interventions to reduce inequality is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective The application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in the healthcare domain is still limited. End-users’ difficulty understanding how the outputs of opaque black AI models are generated contributes to this. It is still unknown which explanations are best presented to end users and how to design the interfaces they are presented in (explanation user interface, XUI). This article aims to provide an overview of recommendations for the user-centered design of XUIs from the scientific literature. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify recommendations for the design of XUIs. Articles published between 2017 and 2022 in English or German, presenting original research or literature reviews, focusing on XUIs for end users or domain experts, which are intended for presentation in graphical user interfaces and from which recommendations could be extracted were included in the review. Articles were retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Explore, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and PsychInfo. A mind map was created to organize and summarize the identified recommendations. Results From the 47 included articles, 240 recommendations for the user-centered design were extracted. The organization in a mind map resulted in 64 summarized recommendations. Conclusion This review provides a synopsis of basic recommendations for the user-centered design of XUIs, focusing on the healthcare domain. During the analysis of the articles, it became clear that no specific and directly implementable design recommendations for AI-based CDSS can be given, but only basic recommendations for raising awareness about the user-centered design of XUIs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face myriad barriers to healthcare, including preventative sexual health services. A street medicine team in one Northern California county observed low uptake of sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening among PEH. We conducted this study to understand the factors contributing to PEH’s decision to seek or accept STI screening. Methods This is a qualitative study using semistructured interviews and demographics surveys among PEH. The interviews focused on understanding facilitators and barriers to STI screening and experiences in healthcare settings more broadly. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thorough memoing process and matrix-based analysis. Results We enrolled a total of 50 adult, English-speaking PEH: 24 men, 26 women; 52% white, 28% Black/African American, 22% Native American, 4% Asian, 22% Hispanic/Latino. Qualitative analysis revealed a theme of ‘dehumanising’ prior experiences in healthcare environments including judgement, dismissal of medical concerns, and denial of treatment. Participants reported similar experiences outside of medical settings, which together shaped their self-worth and factored into their decision to delay seeking routine and urgent forms of care, including STI screening. Approximately half of the participants had received medical services from the street medicine team. PEH perceived the street medicine team to foster trust by physically, emotionally and structurally ‘meeting patients where they are’. Conclusion Prior experiences of exclusion within and outside of healthcare settings informed PEH’s decision to avoid seeking healthcare until extremely urgent, and to deprioritise services like STI screening. In order to develop interventions to increase STI screening and other preventative health services, it is critical to understand the structural elements underlying relationships between PEH and healthcare systems, and the relevance of social exclusion beyond medicine. This street medicine team exemplifies features of structural competency, a model that may be integrated in other settings and in medical education to promote more equitable and inclusive healthcare.",

        "abstract": "This brief provides an innovative and practical manner in which to better engage community advisory boards (CABs) with data analysis. A growing number of scholars are interested in better integrating the community into the data analysis of community based participatory research, community engaged, and/or participatory action research. Participatory data analysis with the community is a critical way diverse communities with lived expertise can inform analysis and interpretation of data grounded in community’s voice, perspectives, and meanings. We describe the cervical cancer project, whereby a community advisory board (CAB) was integrated into qualitative data analysis starting by focusing on the codebook, an integral part of data analysis. This brief provides three specific ways in which participatory qualitative analysis can improve the manner in which research engages the community. We outline one opportunity for scholars to actively engage community partners virtually in the data analysis using the codebook with specific strategies to facilitate participation. We encourage researchers to consider these strategies for disruption when re-thinking the practice of CBPR especially during the analysis stage particularly when it comes to research with black, indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC), under-represented, or marginalized communities with limited English, literacy and/or education levels.",

        "title": "Legality of Professional Mixed Martial Arts in South Africa",
        "abstract": "Senator John McCain may have been on point when he described mixed martial arts (MMA) as “human cock-fighting” in its formative years in the early 1990s in the United States of America (US). Those early MMA contests were no-holds-barred brutal affairs, fought between bloodied combatants of all shapes, sizes and combat styles, in a metal cage. Like bare-knuckle prize-fighting during the 18th and 19th centuries, this new form of combat sport closely resembled a glorified street fight. The sheer brutality of these spectacles ultimately led to the banning of MMA across the US. Realising that MMA’s future depended on governmental sanction and regulation, its organisers actively sought out such sanction and regulation. Although MMA is now legal in all US states, its regulation in both the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa has lagged behind, raising uncertainty about its legality in these jurisdictions. This uncertainty has been exacerbated by the absence of legislative intervention and judicial scrutiny regarding MMA in both the UK and South Africa. There is, furthermore, a dearth of academic literature addressing this legal lacuna. This study endeavours to bridge that gap by examining the legality of MMA in South Africa. In so doing, guidance is sought from the manner in which the English courts have approached boxing and other activities that entail consensual bodily harm, such as sadomasochism.",

        "title": "TYPES OF TERMINOLOGICAL COLLOCATIONS IN MEDICAL ENGLISH DISCOURSE",
        "abstract": "Background. The problem of word compatibility has been actively studied by Western and Russian researchers since the middle of the XX century. Any language is known to be a living and constantly developing system, within which certain speech patterns are formed. According to the lexical approach, words do not exist separately, the language consists of ready-made lexical chunks that can be easily recalled from memory and used while speaking. Such ready-made chunks include collocations, idioms, set expressions, etc. This study is devoted to the problems of common collocations in medical English. \nPurpose – to analyze the lexical content of well-known courses of medical English, authentic dictionaries and textbooks on medicine for identification and classification of terminological collocations. \nMaterials and methods. Courses of medical English published by Oxford and Cambridge University press: «English in Medicine» (E.H. Glendinning, B.A.S. Holmstrom); «Professional English in Use: Medical» (E.H. Glendinning, R. Howard); «Test Your Professional English: Medical» (A. Pohl); «Check Your English Vocabulary for Medicine» (A&C Black); «Nursing 1» (T. Grice), some authentic medical dictionaries (London Dictionary of Medical Terms; Stedman's Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions & Nursing; Illustrated Medical Dictionary - A Dorling Kindersley Book) and textbooks on medicine: Anatomy and Physiology for Health Professionals (J. Moini); Eyewitness. Human Body (R. Walker); How it Works Book of the Human Body (Imagine Publishing Ltd); The Facts on File Illustrated Guide to the Human Body (The Diagram Group). \nResults. The article analyses various definitions of the term \"collocation\", describes its main characteristics, presents the classification of the most common terminological collocations used in medical English. \nThe research shows that various types of terminological collocations are present in different types of medical discourse. These lexical units describe the structure and state of the human body, name medical staff, equipment and technologies, characterize common methods of diagnosis and treatment, etc. Therefore, when working with medical information in English, it is necessary to pay special attention to their structure and use.",

        "title": "Eco-activist imagery in literary texts for children (a case study of English postmodern fairy tales and short stories)",
        "abstract": "This research focuses on the eco-activist multimodal imagery in English postmodern fairy tales and short stories for children as a crucial tool in meaning-making. It is claimed that literary texts for children dynamically reflect current global trends in culture, environmental pollution, gender equality, and family issues. While some topics remain taboo for young readers, others are increasingly prevalent, gradually replacing magical worlds with more realistic, thought-provoking imagery. It has been observed that in recent years, the participation of young people and children in the eco-activist movement has been increasing. They advocate for environmental preservation and solving urgent environmental problems. Literary texts for children are essential tools for fostering a responsible attitude toward the environment at a young age. Due to them, child-readers are introduced to crucial eco-centric issues and ways of solving them and taught the consequences of their actions on nature.\nThe analysis of our case study reveals that the protagonists of eco-activist fairy tales are primarily children concerned about environmental issues. Shadow narratives and the point of view of the child-focaliser are realized by the visual means, i.e. visual metaphors, salience of definite objects on the pictures, interplay of colours and shapes. It has been observed that visual imagery expands, clarifies environmental protection issues and appeals to the better understanding of child-readers their role in preserving the planet and keeping it clean and safe for living. Visual components clearly show the child-reader the damage caused to the environment by human activity: polluted air, water bodies and cities, injured animals, and deforestation. Important meanings are embedded in the dominant colours of the illustrations: green and blue predominate in the illustrations of nature, while grey and black accompany the images of the results of anthropogenic activity. The victory of Good (nature) in fairy tales is represented by a shift from grey and black to green. Intertextual links between literary texts for children by the same author can be formed through illustrations. Thus, a single fictional world is created in which the eco-activist activity of a child-antagonist is not an isolated phenomenon.",

        "title": "Exploring the Applications of Explainability in Wearable Data Analytics: Systematic Literature Review",
        "abstract": "Background Wearable technologies have become increasingly prominent in health care. However, intricate machine learning and deep learning algorithms often lead to the development of “black box” models, which lack transparency and comprehensibility for medical professionals and end users. In this context, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a crucial solution. By providing insights into the inner workings of complex algorithms, XAI aims to foster trust and empower stakeholders to use wearable technologies responsibly. Objective This paper aims to review the recent literature and explore the application of explainability in wearables. By examining how XAI can enhance the interpretability of generated data and models, this review sought to shed light on the possibilities that arise at the intersection of wearable technologies and XAI. Methods We collected publications from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, SpringerLink, JMIR, Nature, and Scopus. The eligible studies included technology-based research involving wearable devices, sensors, or mobile phones focused on explainability, machine learning, or deep learning and that used quantified self data in medical contexts. Only peer-reviewed articles, proceedings, or book chapters published in English between 2018 and 2022 were considered. We excluded duplicates, reviews, books, workshops, courses, tutorials, and talks. We analyzed 25 research papers to gain insights into the current state of explainability in wearables in the health care context. Results Our findings revealed that wrist-worn wearables such as Fitbit and Empatica E4 are prevalent in health care applications. However, more emphasis must be placed on making the data generated by these devices explainable. Among various explainability methods, post hoc approaches stand out, with Shapley Additive Explanations as a prominent choice due to its adaptability. The outputs of explainability methods are commonly presented visually, often in the form of graphs or user-friendly reports. Nevertheless, our review highlights a limitation in user evaluation and underscores the importance of involving users in the development process. Conclusions The integration of XAI into wearable health care technologies is crucial to address the issue of black box models. While wrist-worn wearables are widespread, there is a notable gap in making the data they generate explainable. Post hoc methods such as Shapley Additive Explanations have gained traction for their adaptability in explaining complex algorithms visually. However, user evaluation remains an area in which improvement is needed, and involving users in the development process can contribute to more transparent and reliable artificial intelligence models in health care applications. Further research in this area is essential to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence models used in wearable health care technology.",

        "abstract": "This study examines language issues that arise in social media. Users of TikTok frequently contribute images, videos, and memes. Users of TikTok also left comments on the post in a variety of languages.  Slang is used, and the language style has been studied. The purpose of this study was to understand how slang is put together, what it means, and what its function is. The justification for utilizing slang was revealed in user comments on TikTok. The researcher is interested in talking about the phenomena of African American English slang terms seen in comments on TikTok social media with regard to this issue.  Additionally, this study uses a qualitative, descriptive approach. The information was gathered from TikTok users' comment sections over a specific time period. The theory of the functions of slang is from Zhou and Fan (2013), and the framework for the types of slang is based on the theory of Allan & Burridge (2006). The analysis's findings indicate that there are four categories of slang utilized by TikTok users: Clipping, Acronyms, Fresh and Creative, and Flippant.

This is of great relevance with regard to the forensic assessment of life birth, i.e. (longer) survival time and possible (breast-)feeding before death. While in older German forensic literature, yellow meconium has been occasionally mentioned from the 19th century on - without any conclusions being drawn from this finding whether the newborn was alive or had been fed -, current forensic literature does not provide information about this phenomenon.

        "abstract": "Background & aims Effective treatment for anterior drooling in children with neurological disorders can lead to improved social interactions, reduced physical complications such as perioral infections, and enhanced quality of life for both patients and their parents. Elastic therapeutic taping (ETT) has emerged a novel intervention for drooling, but its evidence was limited. This study systematically reviewed the effectiveness of ETT on reducing anterior drooling in children with neurological disorders. Methods Multiple electronic databases, such as Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception till 30th October 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they: (a) used ETT as a treatment for drooling or swallowing difficulties; (b) included participants aged < 18 years old; (c) included participants with anterior drooling and neurological disorders; (d) compared effects of ETT alone or combined with other treatments (e.g. oral motor therapy (OMT)) with no taping, sham taping or other treatments, and (e) published in English. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used to assess risk of bias for the included studies. Results Seven parallel-arm RCTs, which were conducted in South/southwest Asia, Africa, South America and Middle East, were included. In total, 220 children aged 1 to 11 were included, of which 97 received solely ETT in 4 studies, while 24 received ETT plus OMT in 2 studies. ETT combined with OMT was more effective in reducing drooling in the included 2 RCTs, though the results of ETT alone were inconsistent, likely due to heterogeneity observed in control conditions, application methods, and outcome measures. No side effects were reported in all studies. Conclusions This review suggests that ETT combined with OMT is effective in reducing drooling in children with neurological disorders, with no evidence of side effects.

For this, 17 goals and 162 subgoals were established, agreed by the member countries in 2015 at the COP 21 event in Paris. Therefore, the objective of this Scoping Review was to collect data produced in the world literature, which addressed themes linked to sustainability, education, curriculum, water and basic sanitation, in an integrated way, which dealt more specifically with goals 4 (Quality Education) and 6 (Water and Basic Sanitation) of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It also aimed to find teaching networks in the most diverse countries, which used the curriculum, to bring the themes proposed by the UN into the classroom. To search for articles published in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, the period from June 2017 to June 2022 was taken into account. In addition, official guiding documents were also investigated. A total of 2,803 potential items were obtained. From this total, around 2,720 were eliminated for not meeting the guiding strings in this research, leaving 83 articles/documents. After further reading, 44 articles/documents met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was found on all continents and in the most diverse countries, with different priorities. The countries that are part of the OECD have worked on these issues intending to improve their indicators. The so-called emerging countries (Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa, and Turkey, among others), on the other hand, treat the same data to improve educational metrics and universalize the quality of water supply and sanitation. Finally, in the countries that fall into the peripheral group, the findings were based on a rights guarantee approach, i.e., still from the perspective of implementing and consolidating public policies, such as some Latin American countries, South/Southeast Asia, and the vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries.",

        "abstract": "Background UK Asian and Black patients experience longer cancer diagnostic intervals — the period between initial symptomatic presentation in primary care and cancer diagnosis. Aim To determine whether the differences in diagnostic intervals are because of prolonged primary care, referral, or secondary care interval. Design and setting A cohort study was undertaken of 70 971 patients with seven cancers (breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, oesophagogastric, myeloma, ovarian) diagnosed after symptom presentation in English primary care. Method Data on symptom presentation and diagnosis were extracted from cancer registry-linked primary care and secondary care data. Primary interval was defined as the period between first primary care presentation and secondary care referral, referral interval as the period between referral and first secondary care appointment, and secondary care interval as the period between the first secondary care appointment and diagnosis. Accelerated failure time models were used to investigate ethnic differences across all four intervals. Results Across all sites, the median diagnostic interval was 46 days, ranging from 13 days for breast cancer to 116 days for lung cancer. It was 14% longer for Black patients (adjusted time ratio [ATR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.25) and 13% longer for Asian patients (ATR 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.23) compared with White patients. Site-specific analyses showed that, for myeloma, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, the secondary care interval was longer in Asian and Black patients, who also had a longer primary care interval in breast and colorectal cancer. There was little evidence of ethnic differences in referral interval. Conclusion This study found evidence of ethnic differences in diagnostic intervals, with prolonged secondary care intervals for four common cancers and prolonged primary care intervals for two. Although these differences are relatively modest, they are unjustified and may indicate shortcomings in healthcare delivery that disproportionately affect ethnic minorities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAdults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and adverse social determinants of health experience barriers to healthful eating, and achieve poorer glycemic control and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the impact of medically tailored meals (MTM) with medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on clinical outcomes among adults with DM.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPilot randomized controlled trial.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nEnglish-speaking adults with DM and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels > 8% insured by Maryland Medicaid plans.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nThe treatment group received home delivery of 12 medically tailored, frozen meals and a fresh produce bag weekly for 3 months, and individual calls with a registered dietitian monthly for 6 months in addition to usual care. The control group received usual care. Outcomes were change from baseline to 6 months in A1c (primary), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, food insecurity, and diabetes-related quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy (secondary).\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nWe randomized 74 adults; 77% completed data collection. The mean age was 48 years, 40% were male, 77% were Black, and the mean A1c was 10.3%. Eighty-six percent of meals were delivered, and on average 4.8 nutrition visits were completed. At 6 months, both groups had similar improvements in A1c (- 0.7 vs. - 0.6%); the control group reported more favorable changes in diabetes medications. Changes in systolic blood pressure and BMI at 6 months did not differ between groups. Diabetes-related quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy improved modestly, but not differently by group. Food insecurity decreased significantly from baseline to 3 months in the intervention (53 to 17%) compared to control (48 to 44%; p < 0.05), which lessened but remained significant at 6 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRecruitment and retention of an at-risk group of adults with DM was feasible. Intervention uptake was good but did not improve clinical outcomes. More comprehensive and clinically integrated interventions are likely needed to achieve significant clinical benefits.\n\n\nCLINICALTRIALS\n\n\n\nGOV REGISTRATION\nNCT04034511.",

Physics English terminology comprehension and acquisition is of great importance when it comes to these students. Being the lingua franca of today, mastering the basic terminology of the respective field of interest in English is demanding for everyone who aspires to have a deep understanding of their field of interest and a prosperous career in the future. To have an effective input and output in the teaching/learning process a collaboration among professionals of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and ESP (English for Specific Purposes) is necessitated. Physics is fundamentally dependent on abstract notions that frequently lack tangible counterparts, such as in these metaphoric terms \"tunneling effect\" or \"black hole\".  Concepts expressed through such metaphoric terms assist students to envision, conceive, and acquire the latter, but can also hinder their understanding of concepts. To conduct this research, a semi–structured questionnaire was handed to 100 students of Polytechnic University of Tirana to investigate their beliefs towards these terms and to determine different approaches that will contribute to their understanding of the above-mentioned terms. The results concluded that students face challenges in comprehending a metaphoric unknown term. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the most used and preferred approaches to learning these terms are related to the professor’s assistance with explanation, analogy with everyday experiences, and visual aids, videos mainly. This study highlights the importance of collaboration between STEM and ESP in combining the linguistic-semantic nature of terms and their practical application in the function of students’ terminology acquisition.",

In this discussion article, we explore three issues and tensions we experienced during a 2‐year research–practice partnership overhauling Tier II high school reading intervention practices in a district serving largely African American students. First, we discuss assessment and the challenges of using data and reading theory to simultaneously address system‐level and student‐level needs. Second, we share our process for choosing a curriculum and evaluating its effectiveness. Finally, we weigh how students' African American English may have been related to program implementation and foundational skills development. We share our takeaways to help practitioners and researchers seeking systematic foundational skills improvement across a district, especially districts like ours.",

        "abstract": "The textual adversarial attack refers to an attack method in which the attacker adds imperceptible perturbations to the original texts by elaborate design so that the NLP (natural language processing) model produces false judgments. This method is also used to evaluate the robustness of NLP models. Currently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages. Textual adversarial attacks are a new challenge for the information processing of Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a Tibetan syllable-level black-box textual adversarial attack called TSAttacker based on syllable cosine distance and scoring mechanism. And then, we conduct TSAttacker on six models generated by fine-tuning two PLMs (pre-trained language models) for three downstream tasks. The experiment results show that TSAttacker is effective and generates high-quality adversarial samples. In addition, the robustness of the involved models still has much room for improvement.",

        "abstract": "Background Understanding the prevalence of diseases and where it is detected and recorded in healthcare settings is important for planning effective prevention and care provision. We examined inequalities in the prevalence of 205 chronic conditions and in the care setting where the related diagnoses were recorded in the English National Health Service. Methods We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum linked with Hospital Episode Statistics for 12.8 million patients registered with 1406 general practices in 2018. We mapped diagnoses recorded in primary and secondary care in the previous 12 years. We used linear regressions to assess associations of ethnicity, deprivation, and general practice with a diagnosis being recorded in primary care only, secondary care only, or both settings. Results 72.65% of patients had at least one diagnosis recorded in any care setting. Most diagnoses were reported only in primary care (62.56%) and a minority only in secondary care (15.24%) or in both settings (22.18%). Black (− 0.08 percentage points (pp)), Asian (− 0.08 pp), mixed (− 0.13 pp), and other ethnicity patients (− 0.31 pp) were less likely than White patients to have a condition recorded. Patients in most deprived areas were 0.27 pp more likely to have a condition recorded (+ 0.07 pp in secondary care only, + 0.10 pp in both primary and secondary care, and + 0.10 pp in primary care only). Differences in prevalence by ethnicity were driven by diagnostic recording in primary care. Higher recording of diagnoses in more deprived areas was consistent across care settings. There were large differences in prevalence and diagnostic recording between general practices after adjusting for patient characteristics. Conclusions Linked primary and secondary care records support the identification of disease prevalence more comprehensively. There are inequalities in the prevalence and setting of diagnostic recording by ethnicity, deprivation, and providers on average across conditions. Further research should examine inequalities for each specific condition and whether they reflect also differences in access or recording as well as disease burden. Improving recording where needed and making national linked records accessible for research are key to understanding and reducing inequalities in disease prevention and management.

        "abstract": "Abstract The point of contact between older immigrants and the formal health system is an area of concern for providers, policy makers and researchers. The challenges that often appear in any interaction between older adults and formal providers are exacerbated when the older person is an immigrant because of language and cultural differences, challenges in a family where migration has taken place, and lack of familiarity with the local system for providing care. Attempts to understand these interactions require attention to two sources of diversity – on the one hand the place of origin of the older migrant and all the social, cultural and policy differences in the places of origin on the one hand and the diversity of types of encounters (ambulatory, emergency department, in-patient hospital) with the formal system and the related issues of insurance status on the other. Our study, using data on encounters between persons speaking Chinese, Spanish or Russian to examine use of the three types of encounters to examine patterns of service use for persons with similar health insurance and primary diagnoses. We will focus on the Chinese speakers and their distinctive pattern of use of formal health service compared to the other groups (Including white and Black English speakers). This is especially true in the lower rate of using emergency departments compared to the other groups. We will also address the challenges to studying immigrant experience in health settings when only language of interaction and not place of birth are collected by health providers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Amyloid imaging biomarkers serve an increasingly important role in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and determining eligibility for treatment with new disease‐modifying therapies. Yet, psychological and behavioral reactions to receiving a biomarker informed diagnosis remain relatively unstudied, especially in diverse and underserved populations where the burden of disease is high and resources for support are often insufficient. We developed the Patient And family member Reactions to biomarker‐informed ADRD DiagnosEs (PARADE) Study to address two key gaps in our understanding: 1) the range and trajectory of psychological and behavioral responses to a biomarker informed diagnosis and 2) the support needs of these individuals and their families. Method Leveraging the infrastructure of New IDEAS, a coverage with evidence development study of amyloid PET, we developed a longitudinal study to quantify responses to receiving an amyloid PET biomarker test as part of a clinical work up for a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Patients enrolled in the New IDEAS study are referred through the Alzheimer’s Association’s TrialMatch and then invited to participate with their study partners in 4 remote structured interviews performed prior to their amyloid PET scan and then 4‐, 12‐, and 24‐weeks after result disclosure. The primary outcome of the study is the Impact of Events Scale (IES), a measure of intrusive thoughts. Along with the IES, the interviews include questionnaires to assess the “value of knowing”, anxiety, depression, social support, loneliness, coping style, and discrimination. The goal of the study is to enroll 500 English or Spanish speaking dyads residing in the continental US. We will oversample Latinx and Black/African American participants as a reflection of the New IDEAS population. Result Data collection began in May 2023 at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, Irvine and is expected to be complete the fourth quarter of 2026. Interviews have been completed by telephone and video conference in Spanish and English with relatively low rates of attrition. Conclusion As the field advances to improve diagnosis and treatment, data from studies like this one will be essential to better understanding the patient and family experience of receiving a biomarker informed diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Healthy dietary behaviors (e.g., low-salt diet) are a critical element of self-care and the cornerstone in managing diabetes and/or hypertension. Social determinants (e.g., cultural preferences and social support) influence dietary behaviors. However, little is known about the influence of social determinants on dietary behaviors of African immigrants living with diabetes and/or hypertension accounting for their level of acculturation. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study of a purposive sample of 24 self-identified sub-Saharan African immigrant adults in the Northeastern U.S. with symptomatic hypertension and/or diabetes who spoke and understood English. Based on scores from the Short Acculturation Scale, African immigrants were classified as more or less acculturated. The sample was mainly Nigerian (75%) and males (67%), with a mean age of 59 years [40-72]. The sample was highly educated, acculturated, employed, and reported having enough income to meet their needs. Compared to more-acculturated immigrants, less-acculturated immigrants regularly ate more African or “traditional food,” vegetables and rice, and avoided salt and fatty/fast/processed American foods. Less-acculturated immigrants cooked their meals and learned their diets from previous education or their workplace. Compared to the less acculturated, more acculturated participants ate fruits regularly and avoided meat or red meat. Interestingly, the more acculturated participants reported learning about their diet from family and friends and noted that family members cook the meals in their household. Interventions to promote healthy diets among immigrants should take into consideration cultural dietary preferences, influence of family, friends, and non-familial social connections, and level of acculturation.",

        "abstract": "Overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a global challenge, leading to prolonged waiting times and adverse patient outcomes. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising solution, enabling remote consultation, triage, and real-time specialist input. Despite its growing application, limited systematic research exists on its specific role in ED triage and care. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions in ED settings, focusing on diagnostic accuracy, patient satisfaction, throughput times, and re-admission rates. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases was conducted up to November 10, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English that assessed telemedicine in ED settings. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the modified Downs and Black scale. Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that telemedicine improved diagnostic accuracy, reduced re-consultation rates, and enhanced treatment adherence. High diagnostic concordance with in-person assessments was observed, particularly in non-critical cases. Several studies reported shorter throughput times and higher patient satisfaction with telemedicine compared to traditional care. However, telemedicine's impact on high-acuity cases, such as emergency airway management, was less pronounced. Limitations included small sample sizes and the inability to blind participants, which may have influenced outcomes. Telemedicine holds significant potential to improve ED triage and care in non-critical cases, reducing waiting times and enhancing patient outcomes. Further research is needed to establish its efficacy in high-acuity settings and address challenges related to infrastructure and privacy. Telemedicine should complement in-person care as part of an integrated ED strategy.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early prediction is the need of the hour so that interventions like aspirin prophylaxis can be started. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to predict the disease and its prognosis. This review explores the methodologies, predictors, and performance of ML models for preeclampsia prediction, emphasizing their comparative advantages, challenges, and clinical applicability. We conducted a systematic search of databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus for studies published in the last 10 years using terms such as “preeclampsia”, “risk factors”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, and “deep learning”. Words and phrases were selected using MeSH, a controlled vocabulary. Appropriate articles were selected using Boolean operators “OR” and “AND”. The database search yielded 325 records. After removing duplicates and non-English articles, and completing a title and abstract search 55 research articles were assessed for eligibility of which 11 were included in this review. The risk of bias was found to be high in three of the studies and low in the rest. Clinicodemographic characteristics, laboratory reports, Doppler ultrasound, and some innovative ones like genotypic data and fundal images were predictors used to train ML models. More than ten different ML models were used in the 11 studies from diverse countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Korea. The area under the curve varied from 0.76 to 0.97. ML algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and neural networks consistently demonstrated superior predictive accuracy Non-interpretable or black box ML models may not find clinical application on ethical grounds. The future of preeclampsia prediction using ML lies in balancing model performance with interpretability. Human oversight remains indispensable in implementing and interpreting these models to achieve better maternal outcomes. Further research and validation across diverse populations are critical to establishing the universal applicability of these promising ML-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Poor sleep health has been associated with worse cognitive and health outcomes in older adults. Less is known about this relationship in midlife. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between self‐reported sleep health, cognitive function, and performance on common health tasks among middle‐aged adults, as sleep may be a modifiable target to address later life risk of cognitive decline. Method English‐speaking adults aged 35‐64 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health centers in the greater Chicagoland area. Multidimensional sleep health (regularity, satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration) was measured by the RU‐SATED questionnaire. Global cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); age‐ and education‐adjusted Z‐scores were calculated. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA Z‐score lower than one standard deviation below population mean. Performance on common health tasks (e.g. comprehension of print health material, recall of spoken instructions, dosing medications, recall of multimedia education) were assessed using the Comprehensive Health Activities Scale (CHAS). We examined the association between sleep health, cognitive impairment, and health task performance using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Covariates, selected a priori, included age, sex, number of chronic conditions, and depressive symptoms. Result A total of 310 participants (mean age 51.2 ± 8.1; 66% female; 39% non‐Hispanic Black, 32% non‐Hispanic White, 21% Hispanic; 54% with 2+ chronic conditions) were included in analyses. The median sleep health score was 8 (interquartile range: 6‐10) and cognitive impairment was found in 11.3%. Poorer sleep health was significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting for a priori covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96‐0.99; P = 0.007). Both poorer sleep health (ß, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.22‐1.99; P = 0.014) and cognitive impairment (ß, ‐27.7; CI, (‐34.3)‐(‐21.1); P<0.001) were independently associated with poorer performance on health tasks, after adjusting for a priori covariates. Conclusion Poorer self‐reported sleep health in midlife was associated with a greater likelihood of cognitive impairment, whereas both poorer sleep health and cognitive impairment were associated with lower self‐management abilities to navigate healthcare. Future studies should examine whether sleep‐targeted intervention in midlife can mitigate cognitive later‐life decline and poorer health outcomes.",

        "title": "Lifestyle Factors’ Influence on Episodic Memory: A Gradient Boosted Tree Analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Comprehending the role of participatory lifestyle factors influencing the aging process and subsequent cognitive outcomes is imperative for postulating ways to combat cognitive decline. Recent research points to the independent impacts of leisure time activities (LTAs), physical performance (measures of physical fitness) and socialization (relationships and interaction frequency) on healthy cognitive aging, although the relative importance of this triad of factors is poorly delineated. Method From baseline data of two studies examining cognitive aging in older, diverse populations— “Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans” and “Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences,” we scraped subjects’ self‐reported data and Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS) measured cognitive performance scores. Lifestyle survey questions revealed features that well‐represented each category in the triad. These features were used as model inputs, along with sex, education, and income. The cohort consisted of n = 1684 subjects, each characterized by 23 features, after removal for missingness. We applied a grid search algorithm with 5‐fold cross‐validation to tune the hyperparameters of a gradient boosted decision tree model. Optimized for accuracy and generalizability, these parameters defined the model to predict episodic memory scores. Per prediction, relative feature importances were computed as Shapley values. Mean absolute importances (global importance) for the full cohort were derived from the relative values. For triad comparison, summated global importance of the features for each lifestyle category was calculated. Result Group importance ranking revealed aggregated LTAs with the largest contribution to episodic scores, followed by physical performance, then socialization. Notable LTAs included complex cooking, taking classes, and gaming. Although no individual mean absolute feature importance surpassed that of sex, the aggregate importance of the LTA and physical performance groups did; all categories exceeded education and income. Conclusion Our major finding indicates that, beyond the typical factors of interest for episodic memory and healthy cognitive aging, the way one spends their free‐time has a strong association with these outcomes, and suggests LTAs are the most important. It’s worth noting that these three domains may overlap (ex. recreational sporting activities). This research may influence public health guidelines for promoting healthy cognitive aging.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Both limited health literacy (HL) and elevated blood pressure variability (BPV) in later life have been associated with the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the relationship between HL, BPV, and domain‐specific cognitive decline. We aimed to examine this relationship among primary care older adults. Method English‐speaking adults aged 55‐74 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health centers in Chicago between 8/2008 and 6/2010. HL was measured by the Newest Vital Sign. BPV was assessed by variation independent of mean systolic blood pressure calculated from all blood pressure measures obtained during routine ambulatory visits that occurred in calendar years 2008 – 2012. Five cognitive domains (processing speed, inductive reasoning, and working, long‐term, and prospective memories) were assessed through 15 tests at baseline, which were repeated three additional times at a 2.5‐year interval. Changes in Z‐scores were calculated from baseline (T1) to the last available assessment (T4 or T3) for each of the five cognitive domains. We examined associations between BPV and domain‐specific cognitive changes with univariate and multivariable regression, adjusting for a priori covariates including baseline age, sex, race, hypertension, number of chronic conditions excluding hypertension, cognitive function, HL, and interval between cognitive assessments. Result A total of 299 participants (age 63.3 ± 5.3; 73% female; 26% non‐Hispanic Black, 67% non‐Hispanic White; 1.8 ± 1.3 chronic conditions; 51.8% with hypertension at baseline) were included in analyses (Table 1). Median interval between cognitive assessments was 8.4 years (IQR 8.2‐8.7). Baseline hypertension (β, 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28‐1.71; p = 0.006) and limited HL (β, 1.42; CI, 0.65‐2.20; p<0.001) were significant predictors of 5‐year BPV (Table 2). Greater 5‐year BPV was significantly associated with decline in long‐term memory (β, ‐0.035; CI, (‐0.064)‐(‐0.007); p = 0.016), but not with changes in other cognitive domains, after adjusting for a priori covariates (Table 3). Conclusion Limited health literacy in later life is associated with greater variability of systolic blood pressure over five years, which was, in turn, associated with greater decline in long‐term memory over a median follow‐up of eight years.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, Colorado State University Extension (CSUE) has focused on meeting the needs of historically marginalized communities with the highest rates of health disparities and social isolation. These disparities are largely due to language barriers and gaps in cultural competencies among healthcare providers. To bring healthy aging education and support to culturally diverse and underserved communities, CSUE led the adaptation of National Council on Aging’s (NCOA) Aging Mastery Program (AMP), a ten-session evidence-based curriculum (available in both English and Spanish) that supports older adults in aging well. The adaptation of AMP was implemented with Native American, Spanish-dominant immigrant, and East African refugee populations in Colorado. To adapt the program, we utilized state data to identify priority communities. Next, we conducted listening sessions to understand each community’s unique perspectives with a significant focus on developing trusting relationships. We then identified and supported members of each community as champions to teach the curriculum with CSUE’s coaching and technical assistance. Finally, we empowered these champions and their class participants to identify other gaps in knowledge and areas of interest, creating opportunities to develop ‘booster’ sessions. We prioritized paying our community champions to teach and lead in their communities. As a result, we’ve co-written grants and papers and created new programs alongside these champions. We are currently exploring expanding AMP in eight new communities across Colorado. Our program adaptation process has helped to break down barriers to implementing culturally relevant programs with underserved communities while bridging health equity gaps across the state.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Few studies have assessed the relationships between language, race, and code status in a PICU. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify whether non-English language preference (NELP) or race was associated with code status in a PICU. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of 45,143 patients admitted to the PICU between January 2013 and December 2022, excluding those with pre-PICU do not resuscitate (DNR) orders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two separate exposures were tested simultaneously (NELP and race/ethnicity) for association with the primary outcome of placement of a DNR order in the PICU (logistic regression). The secondary outcome was time to DNR order in patients in whom DNR orders were placed (Cox regression). Potential confounders were age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III at 12 hours score, religion, admission diagnosis, and hospital length of stay before PICU admission. RESULTS: Patients with Spanish-preference, Arabic-preference, or other NELP had higher odds of having a DNR order placed during PICU admission relative to English-preference (all adjusted odds ratios [aORs] between 1.81 and 3.59; all p < 0.001). Among patients with a DNR, Other NELP patients had faster times to DNR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30–2.39; p < 0.001). Non-Hispanic Black patients consistently had lower odds of having a DNR order relative to non-Hispanic White patients (aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.91; p = 0.002). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with NELP had higher odds of having a new DNR order placed in the PICU, whereas non-Hispanic Black patients had lower odds. NELP may be correlated with unmeasured illness severity, thereby confounding the relationship between language and probability of DNR. However, our data support that demographic factors, such as Black race, are strong predictors of a change in code status to DNR and time to DNR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Gender differences are often associated with specific cognitive domains. Additionally, gender may be associated with BMI through biological and social differences. We evaluated if mid‐life BMI mediated the effect of gender on domain specific cognition in an ethnoracially diverse population of individuals 80+. Method Data from three ongoing cohort studies, LifeAfter90, Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences, and Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans, was pooled to include participants aged 80+ (n = 671). Baseline verbal episodic memory (VEM), executive function (EF), and semantic memory (SM) were measured using the z‐standardized Spanish English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. Mid‐life BMI was categorized as normal (18.5‐24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25‐29.9 kg/m2), and obese (30 kg/m2) using the first clinical measurement at ages 40‐60. Structural equation models were used to estimate the indirect effect (IDE) of mid‐life BMI category on the association between gender and cognition adjusting for age at baseline cognitive assessment, age at BMI measurement, racial/ethnic identity, and education. Result Participants were 37% male, 17% Asian, 35% Black, 12% Latino, 33% White, 3% other racial/ethnic group with a mean age of 88.5±5.3 at baseline cognitive assessment and a mean age at mid‐life BMI measure of 44.6±4.3 years (table 1). Midlife obesity (9%) and overweight (31%) were common. The total effect of gender (ref = women) on each cognitive domain was significant (VEM: ‐0.19, p < 0.001; EF: ‐0.12, p = 0.001; SM: 0.202, p < 0.001). Five percent (p‐value = 0.07) of the association between gender and VEM was explained by BMI category (IDE (β = ‐0.01; p‐value = 0.06) divided by total effect (β = ‐0.19; (p‐value<0.001); Figure 1). BMI did not mediate the association between gender and SM (β(IDE) = ‐0.003;p‐value = 0.29) or between gender and EF (β(IDE) = ‐0.005; p‐value = 0.19). Conclusion In this ethnoracially diverse population of individuals aged 80+, mid‐life BMI marginally mediated the association between gender and baseline VEM, while it did not mediate the associations with EF and SM. Additionally, men had lower EF and VEM but higher SM compared to women. The effect of mid‐life BMI on the association between gender and cognition may vary by cognitive domain, suggesting that mid‐life BMI may impact specific late‐life cognitive functions that are associated with VEM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives As artificial intelligence evolves, integrating speech processing into home healthcare (HHC) workflows is increasingly feasible. Audio-recorded communications enhance risk identification models, with automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as a key component. This study evaluates the transcription accuracy and equity of 4 ASR systems—Amazon Web Services (AWS) General, AWS Medical, Whisper, and Wave2Vec—in transcribing patient-nurse communication in US HHC, focusing on their ability in accurate transcription of speech from Black and White English-speaking patients. Materials and Methods We analyzed audio recordings of patient-nurse encounters from 35 patients (16 Black and 19 White) in a New York City-based HHC service. Overall, 860 utterances were available for study, including 475 drawn from Black patients and 385 from White patients. Automatic speech recognition performance was measured using word error rate (WER), benchmarked against a manual gold standard. Disparities were assessed by comparing ASR performance across racial groups using the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) tool, focusing on 10 linguistic dimensions, as well as specific speech elements including repetition, filler words, and proper nouns (medical and nonmedical terms). Results The average age of participants was 67.8 years (SD = 14.4). Communication lasted an average of 15 minutes (range: 11-21 minutes) with a median of 1186 words per patient. Of 860 total utterances, 475 were from Black patients and 385 from White patients. Amazon Web Services General had the highest accuracy, with a median WER of 39%. However, all systems showed reduced accuracy for Black patients, with significant discrepancies in LIWC dimensions such as “Affect,” “Social,” and “Drives.” Amazon Web Services Medical performed best for medical terms, though all systems have difficulties with filler words, repetition, and nonmedical terms, with AWS General showing the lowest error rates at 65%, 64%, and 53%, respectively. Discussion While AWS systems demonstrated superior accuracy, significant disparities by race highlight the need for more diverse training datasets and improved dialect sensitivity. Addressing these disparities is critical for ensuring equitable ASR performance in HHC settings and enhancing risk prediction models through audio-recorded communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Social determinants of health have been associated with disparities in health outcomes, including cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. While individual‐level disparities have been characterized, more research is needed into structural social determinants of health (SSDoH) and their association with cognitive outcomes, especially for those in midlife. This study aimed to investigate the association between SSDoH and subjective and objective measures of cognitive impairment. Methods English‐speaking adults ages 35‐64 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health network in the Chicagoland area. SSDoH was evaluated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a validated factor‐based index of neighborhood socioeconomic context using participant census block, then divided into terciles with the highest tercile indicating highest neighborhood deprivation. Subjective cognitive concern was measured by a single question assessing concern about cognitive or memory issues as part of the Everyday Cognition Cog scales. Objective cognition was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with MoCA < 23 (out of 30) indicating cognitive impairment. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to characterize the relationship between SSDoH and cognitive impairment, including a priori covariates of age, sex, education, and number of chronic conditions. Results A total of 596 participants (age 52±8; 64% female; 42% non‐Hispanic Black, 34% non‐Hispanic White, 16% Hispanic; 62% college graduate) were included in the analysis. Younger age, female sex, non‐Hispanic Black race, and lower education and income were associated with higher ADI (Table 1). One‐third of participants (34%) reported subjective cognitive concern, whereas objective cognitive impairment was found in 22.6%. Compared to the lowest ADI tercile (i.e. least deprived), the highest ADI tercile (i.e. most deprived) was significantly associated with objective cognitive impairment (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5‐5.9; p = 0.001) but not subjective cognitive concerns (aOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7‐2.0; p = 0.46), after adjusting for a priori covariates (Table 2).

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Certain air pollutants have carcinogenic and estrogenic properties that can contribute to breast cancer development. This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and breast cancer based on epidemiological evidence. This systematic review included articles published between 2013 and 2022 from Scopus and PubMed databases, focusing on cohort and nested case-control studies examining the association between outdoor air pollution and breast cancer. A total of 25 articles were included. A total of eight outdoor pollutants were analyzed, with seven showing a significant association with breast cancer risk. Specifically, the strong association between benzo[a]pyrene and breast cancer risk was reported. Furthermore, all four studies on nitrogen oxides (NOx), fifteen out of eighteen (83.33%) on particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), nine out of thirteen studies (69.23%) on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and three out of seven studies (42.86%) on particulate matter less than 10 µm PM10 showed an association with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05–1.56; odds ratio [OR]: 1.03–1.86). In contrast, only one out of three studies (33.33%) on O3 (HR: 0.76–1.03) and all studies on cadmium (OR: 0.88–0.97) suggested a negative association with breast cancer risk. None of the studies on black carbon found an association with breast cancer risk. It is important to note the methodological limitations of this review, including potential publication bias due to the inclusion of only English-language articles and a regional focus on developed countries, which may limit the generalizability of findings. This study suggests that exposure to outdoor air pollutants is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship and the mechanisms by which environmental pollutants may trigger carcinogenic effects and contribute to breast cancer development through epigenetic pathways.",

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and SPORTDiscus) were searched from 1970 to 2023. Eligibility criteria Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they: (1) were written in English; (2) included male or female elite athletes that had been retired ≥1 year; (3) included a control group or population reference values; (4) reported the time-point prevalence of anxiety and/or depression; and (5) were of a retrospective, longitudinal or prospective, methodological design. A modified version of the Downs and Black tool was used to determine risk of bias. Results 37 unique studies including 24 732 former athletes (2% female) were included in the meta-analysis. The time-point prevalence of anxiety (prevalence ratio (PR): 2.08 (95% CI 1.57 to 2.60)) and depression (PR: 2.58 (95% CI 2.04 to 3.12)) in former athletes was over twice that of the general population. Subgroup analyses revealed former American football players and jockeys had the highest time-point prevalence of both anxiety and depression (PR: 2.24–2.88), whereas the time-point prevalence of depression and anxiety was not significantly different to the general population for former rugby players (PR: 1.13–1.30).

A search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases for psychological interventions for pain in older adults over the age of 50. We also searched review articles. Search terms were chronic pain OR pain; older adults OR elderly OR geriatric OR aged OR human; pain management OR nonpharmacological pain management OR intervention OR psychotherapy; randomized control trial. Papers had to be in English, a randomized clinical trial, with pain as the primary outcome, and the treatment had to be a psychological intervention. We coded studies that had at least a 90% minority sample as a trial specific to a minority population or if one of the groups was minority. From 14,000 studies identified by the search, we reviewed 485 full texts. Of those,129 psychological interventions studies on older adults with chronic pain met inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 6 African-American, 7 Asian,1 Turkish, and 2 Iranian samples. Studies represented 24 countries. However, 72 studies did not provide enough information about ethnicity or race. The lack of reporting of race and ethnicity took place across many disciplines and journal types. All journals should require reporting ethnic and racial demographics of participants to increase generalizability of findings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The Good Life program for healthy brain aging (TGL) is an online program for positive lifestyle change that is made up of exercise, diet and social support classes. Since 2020, The Good Life has served thousands of older Californians. Currently, we host 17 classes weekly for our 750 active members (in both English and Spanish). Our exercise and cooking classes are our most watched content. Exercise classes attendance is 20‐70 participants per show (x11 weekly). Our x3/week cooking classes attendance is 20‐50 participants per show. We provide The Good Life freely and, in the process, engender goodwill ‐ a proven pathway to rebuilding trust and fostering reciprocity. The Good Life enjoys funding support from the State of California as public health program to support Black and Latinx healthy aging. In 2023 it expanded broadly across 13 California counties participating in the CDC’s Healthy Bain Initiative, providing TGL to all California residents. Three of the 13 counties are now creating local content tailor made to their specific ethno‐geographies. Method TGL is implementing a 9‐step infrastructure building plan to (1) Extend this California program to scale nationally to serve large numbers of participants in NIA clinical research and training network centers; (2) Engage Black and Latinx American communities across the nation in a thoughtful, fun, and clinically meaningful health education campaign with messaging that will facilitate recruitment and enhance retention; (3) Evaluate the success of our precision engagement program using empirical metrics: (i) participant enrollment into clinical trials, (ii) time spent watching content per digital segment, (iii) number of clicks into subsequent public health messaging. These metrics will be correlated with participant data describing changes in attitudes re (a) Trust in Biomedical Research and (b) Stages of Research Volunteerism. Result Since May 2023, TGL has recruited 260 Black Americans into 3 academic clinical research programs. Conclusion TGL is a scalable internet‐based program with potential reach well beyond its large existing membership.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Midlife cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) are associated with late‐life cognitive impairment, but also mortality. We evaluated their association with cognitive decline in a diverse cohort of older adults who survived to age 80 without diagnosis of dementia. Method Three harmonized cohorts of long‐term Kaiser Permanente members were pooled and restricted to those aged 80+. We measured CVRF from Multiphasic Health Check‐ups (MHC; 1964‐1985), which assessed hyperlipidemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, diabetes, and smoking status. Standardized z‐scores for executive function (EF) and verbal episodic memory (VEM) were measured over up to 8 waves (2017‐2023) using the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. Linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes associated CVRF, separately, with cognitive decline adjusting for age at MHC, age at cognitive assessment, race (Asian/Black/Latino/white/multiracial), education (≤high school/some college/≤college), assessment mode (in‐person/telephone), and practice effects. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the count of CVD risk factors stratified by smoking status. Result Participants (n = 935) averaged 40.6(±7.9) years of age at MHC, 88.0(±4.9) years at baseline cognitive assessment, and 61.4% were women (Table 1). At midlife, 47% had hyperlipidemia, 23% hypertension, 34% overweight/obese, 1% diabetes, and 51% ever smoked. Hyperlipidemia was associated with worse baseline EF (β(95% CI):‐0.24(‐0.36,‐0.12)), smoking was associated with better EF (β:0.13(0.01,0.25)), and hypertension was associated with worse EF (β:‐0.14(‐0.25, 0.002)), though the effect was not statistically significant (Table 2). There were no associations between CVRF and EF decline. Hyperlipidemia was the only CVRF associated with worse baseline VEM (β:‐0.18(‐0.31,‐0.05)), and no CVRF was associated with VEM decline (Table 2). Despite smokers having higher baseline EF compared to nonsmokers, having 3+ CVRF was associated with steeper decline in both groups compared to those with fewer CVRF (Figure 1). Baseline VEM was similar between smokers and non‐smokers, and for both smokers and nonsmokers, the steepest declines in VEM were among those with one CVRF. Conclusion In this diverse cohort, midlife hyperlipidemia was associated with worse cognition in late life. A positive association between smoking and EF may be indicative of resilience among midlife smokers who have reached age 80+. Regardless of smoking status, multiple CVD risk factors may be detrimental to cognitive function, particularly EF.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Studies are limited regarding the role of intersectional social determinants of health in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology (ADNP). Method We analyzed data on 3,107 participants in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Neuropathology Dataset who had a visit ≤24 months before autopsy and confirmed ADNP (moderate to frequent neuritic plaques and Braak Stage III‐VI). Groups were defined based on the presence (symptomatic ADNP, n = 2,956) or absence (asymptomatic ADNP, n = 151) of an MCI/dementia diagnosis at the final visit before death. Social determinants included gender (man/women), educational attainment (years), racialized group (Black, White, other), Hispanic ethnicity, living alone, and English/non‐English primary language. Multivariable logistic regression tested associations between these determinants and ADNP classification (asymptomatic vs symptomatic), and additionally, the models were stratified by gender. Models controlled for age at death, apolipoprotein e4 carrier status, informant‐reported memory decline, time between last visit and autopsy, vascular and Lewy body pathology, and comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, depression). Results Women (versus men) were more likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00‐1.03), as were those with greater years of education (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.004‐1.006), Hispanic individuals (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03‐1.11), and those living alone (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06‐1.17). Non‐English primary language speakers were less likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85‐0.92). Gender‐stratified analyses showed that both women and men were more likely to have asymptomatic ADNP if they were Hispanic (women: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02‐1.11; men: OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.08) or living alone (women: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07‐1.18; men: OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02‐1.18). Women speaking a non‐English primary language were less likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83‐0.91), while in men, more years of education was associated with greater odds of asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.002‐1.007). Conclusion Our study suggests that gender, education, Hispanic ethnicity, primary language, and living alone, as well as the intersectionality of these factors with gender, may differentially influence MCI/dementia diagnosis prior to death in the presence of ADNP. These findings emphasize the need for future Alzheimer’s disease research to prioritize intersectional social determinants of brain health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Healthy dietary behaviors (e.g., low-salt diet) are a critical element of self-care and the cornerstone in managing diabetes and/or hypertension. Social determinants (e.g., cultural preferences and social support) influence dietary behaviors. However, little is known about the influence of social determinants on dietary behaviors of African immigrants living with diabetes and/or hypertension accounting for their level of acculturation. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study of a purposive sample of 24 self-identified sub-Saharan African immigrant adults in the Northeastern U.S. with symptomatic hypertension and/or diabetes who spoke and understood English. Based on scores from the Short Acculturation Scale, African immigrants were classified as more or less acculturated. The sample was mainly Nigerian (75%) and males (67%), with a mean age of 59 years [40-72]. The sample was highly educated, acculturated, employed, and reported having enough income to meet their needs. Compared to more-acculturated immigrants, less-acculturated immigrants regularly ate more African or “traditional food,” vegetables and rice, and avoided salt and fatty/fast/processed American foods. Less-acculturated immigrants cooked their meals and learned their diets from previous education or their workplace. Compared to the less acculturated, more acculturated participants ate fruits regularly and avoided meat or red meat. Interestingly, the more acculturated participants reported learning about their diet from family and friends and noted that family members cook the meals in their household. Interventions to promote healthy diets among immigrants should take into consideration cultural dietary preferences, influence of family, friends, and non-familial social connections, and level of acculturation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive impairment (CI) and depression often co-occur, and each is known to impair older adults’ ability to perform activities of daily living. We sought to determine whether co-morbid depression moderates the association of CI with impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We recruited English speaking adults ages ≥55 years without preexisting dementia or CI from primary care practices in New York City and Chicago (n=1,045). IADLs were assessed using Lawton’s 8-item scale and impairment was defined as ≥1 activity requiring assistance. Cognitive function was measured using Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA); moderate-severe CI was defined as MoCA score ≥1.5 standard deviations below the age and education adjusted z-score. Depression was defined as a score ≥10 using Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ)-8. We fit linear regression models estimating the association of mild CI, moderate-severe CI, and depression with counts of IADL impairments, adjusting for age and sex. We then added an interaction term for CI and depression. The mean age was 67 (8.0) years, 54% were female, 35% Black and 25% Hispanic. Median IADL impairments were 0 (IQR 0-7); 16% had mild CI, 5% moderate-severe CI, and 15% had depression. Moderate-severe CI (β=0.84, p< 0.01) and severe depression (β=1.31, p< 0.01) were each independently associated with IADL impairments in the adjusted model. The interaction term of moderate-severe CI with depression was also significant (β -0.85, p < 0.01). Depression significantly worsens the association of CI with IADL impairment, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating this common condition in older adults.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nearly 50 years after the fall of Saigon (1975), studies continue to show the high prevalence of physical (ADL, IADL), mental (depressive symptoms), and cognitive (dementia) disabilities in older Vietnamese refugees. Adverse lifelong experiences in Vietnam and host countries may have impacted these results. Some refugees who arrived during their youth became health professionals while their children attend universities, predominantly enrolled in pre-health courses. Leveraging their bilingual/bicultural and health background, they have hosted free health fairs for their monolingual older Vietnamese for the past 16 years in Houston, Texas, the 2nd largest Vietnamese-populated city in the nation. Despite the high prevalence of dementia, no free cognitive healthcare has been provided. The purpose of the study is to report the collaborative efforts to fill the gap using the Cultural Exchange Model (CEM) and improve dementia literacy. The CEM teaches that to create knowledge, two constituencies need to merge within the Community. One arm of Vietnamese stakeholders (older adults, medical doctors) already exists. We formed another arm, Cognitive Health Initiative (CHAIN): 28 bilingual/bicultural Vietnamese university students, who were trained in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). During 2023, we jointly attended 11 health fairs with Vietnamese medical professionals and offered 337 MoCA in Vietnamese and English. The results showed that older Vietnamese (≥65) scored the lowest (22.4/30) among participants (White=24.8; Black=23.9; Hispanic=23.3). Utilizing existing, underlying resilience and the unique affinity among local Vietnamese health professionals, our next steps include continuing to offer a “Memory Booth” by local Vietnamese pre-health students, thereby strengthening intergenerational relationships.",

        "abstract": "Background Heat-altered stones (HAS) are commonly reported in prehistoric sites across several continents, yet they continue to be generally overlooked and systematic studies on them are scarce. Methods We performed a systematic literature review which consisted of searching journal articles, book chapters and books published in English, in Scopus and Web of Science. We collected information on their geographic distribution, chronology, composition, technological aspects and subsistence contexts from 73 records. Our aims were to assess the challenges and opportunities of analysing HAS, while highlighting that this class of artefacts is still largely an untapped source of information on prehistoric human activities. Results HAS have been documented since the Pleistocene, attesting that culinary and non-culinary activities using heating stones emerged among foraging groups subsisting on hunting, fishing and gathering. The high frequency of HAS during the middle and late Holocene testifies to the continuation of some practices over long time periods, amid the emergence of new food systems, and the introduction of new resources and technologies, such as domesticated plants and animals, and ceramic containers. A considerable lack of studies on HAS from Africa, Oceania, Asia, and South America was noted, all of which are key geographic areas for assessing the role of heating stones in human evolution, geographic dispersal, early cuisine and diet, and cultural transmission across the globe. Conclusions Our results highlight the persistent challenges archaeologists face in establishing fundamental definitions and diagnostic criteria for identifying HAS, while emphasizing the importance of HAS as essential elements for studying ancient foodways and cultural heritage. We call on archaeologists and cultural heritage managers to reconsider the heritage value of HAS and include them in specialised research agendas before significant knowledge of our past is lost.",

        "abstract": "The research work is devoted to the analysis of the English language variability specific characteristics in the context of modern community globalization process. The research proves that the English language variant, adapting to the realities of local languages and cultures, acquires new sociolinguistic properties. The aim of the study is to identify the specifics of such a variant of the English language as the South African English which was formed during the contact interaction of the British English language and the autochthonous languages and cultures of South Africa. The key properties of the South African English are revealed on the basis of methods groups: analysis and synthesis; comparative analysis; and the method of component analysis. The key attention is paid to the historical process formation of South African English and to the development of the English language and its role in the life of South Africa. The complex nature of long-term historical inter language and intercultural interaction has led to the formation of a heterogeneous structure of South African society, is which is presented by Europeans, numerous local peoples, Indians and their descendants living on the same territory. The complex differentiation of South African society has defined a unique variety of languages, dialects, and sociolects, among which English has a special social prestige and unites all other languages. Having a multicomponent structure, sociolinguistic differentiation of South African society contributed to the emergence and functioning a series of South African English variants types in one territory. These types are: Black South African English, White South African English, Coloured South African English. The English language of each sociolinguistic group has unique features that manifest themselves to a greater extent at the phonetic level.",

        "abstract": "The article analyzes the emergence of European values in the concepts of philosophers of Ancient Greece and state thinkers of Ancient Rome. \nThe author shows their further development under the influence of Christianity, social church doctrine, ideas of German classical philosophers, thinkers of the Enlightenment, and founders of the concept of natural law.The significance of the first European documents on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the Magna Charta of 1215, the Habeas Corpus of 1679, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, the first constitutions in Europe, and the US Constitution (1787) are studied. The study of the genesis of the values on which the EU is based today takes into account the development of the Ukrainian state and law and their impact on this process, in particular the establishment of Greek city-states in the Southern Black Sea region, the introduction of Christianity in Kyivan Rus. The significance of the documents and treaties of Kyivan Rus and the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk (1710) in terms of their compliance with the values of the EU and their influence on their formation is clarified. Particular attention is paid to the evolution of EU values after the conclusion of the 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms within the framework of the Council of Europe and the creation of the European Communities. The author analyzes the texts of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (1951), the Treaty on the European Economic Community (1957), and the Single European Act (1986).The transformation of EU values and their legal nature from the Draft Treaty on a Constitution for Europe (2003) to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2001), which became part of the Lisbon Treaty (2009), is studied in more detail. Special attention is paid to the evolution of legal terminology in EU law, when the term «principles» is still used in the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the term «values» is used in the text of the Treaty of Lisbon. The author shows how values developed from philosophical, concepts, under the influence of religious and political teachings, supplemented and transformed in EU law from legal principles to values. In the final part of the article, conclusions are formulated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background People of African and Caribbean heritage in the UK have a higher prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and poorer health outcomes than white Europeans. Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles for Diabetes Online (HEAL‐D Online) is a co‐designed, culturally tailored T2D self‐management programme for black African and Caribbean adults, which, due to online delivery, is well positioned for spread. This qualitative evaluation uses the Exploration‐Preparation‐Implementation‐Sustainment (EPIS) framework to explore factors affecting scale‐up from delivery and commissioning perspectives. Methods Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with nine commissioners and providers of T2D services from three English areas with varying population characteristics to explore scale‐up. Focus groups were held with 15 people of African and Caribbean heritage with T2D lived experience to explore the impact of a digital model of participation. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, with themes mapped onto the EPIS framework exploration phase constructs to consider the outer and inner contextual factors for planning implementation. Results Six EPIS constructs were identified by commissioners and providers as key in scaling HEAL‐D Online. People with T2D lived experience explored the online mode of delivery, using the patient advocacy construct as the analytical lens. In delivering an online T2D programme, two themes were identified: (1) aligning course content with people's preferences; (2) practicalities to ensure online delivery was acceptable and accessible to the community. Conclusions HEAL‐D Online was acceptable with the potential to help address health inequalities. The EPIS framework provided a structure to understand factors in planning scale‐up for an intervention targeting underserved communities.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate trends and inequalities in statin use for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) Design Repeated cross-sectional and historical cohort study designs Setting English primary care electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care Participants 5 million adults aged 25 years and older randomly sampled from CPRD Aurum between 1st April 2009 and 31st December 2021. Outcome measures Monthly proportion of current statin users; adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for statin initiation; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for cardiovascular risk assessment, statin discontinuation and statin re-initiation and number of CVD events prevented with optimal statin use and estimated costs saved. Results The overall monthly proportion of individuals prescribed statins for primary prevention increased from 22.3% in 2009 to 35.6% in 2021 among those aged 70+ years, and was stable in other age groups. The proportion of eligible individuals receiving a statin for secondary prevention was higher in all age groups (e.g. increasing from 68.1% to 73.7% over the same period, in those aged 70+). Overall prevalence of statin use was lowest among women, 25-39 age group, and black, mixed, and other ethnic groups for both primary and secondary prevention. Monthly proportion of CVD risk assessment, among those eligible, increased from 13.7% in May 2009 to 31.8% by November 2021. 79.0% of individuals were initiated statins within 60 days of a CVD event. Women (aOR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68-0.72) and people of black ethnicity (aOR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77) were less likely to be initiated statins compared to those of white ethnicity while people of south Asian ethnicity (aOR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42-1.64) were more likely to be initiated statins than white people for secondary prevention. Statin discontinuation was most likely among women (aHR 1.08, 95% CI; 1.06-1.11) black people (aHR 1.76, 95% CI, 1.65-1.89) and the most deprived group (aHR 1.08, 95% CI; 1.04-1.12) compared to men, white people and the least deprived group, respectively, for primary prevention with similar associations seen for secondary prevention for ethnicity and deprivation. With optimal statin treatment, over 150,000 cardiovascular events could be prevented in the next 10 years for primary prevention and 5 years for secondary prevention resulting in a potential saving to the health service of over 400 million (GBP) in those eligible for statins. Conclusion Statin use remains suboptimal and inequalities particularly among women, people of black ethnicity and those in the most deprived socioeconomic groups persist across multiple stages of statin use for both primary and secondary prevention. To reduce these inequalities and avoid missed opportunities to prevent cardiovascular events and costs to the NHS, strategies are needed specifically targeting these patient groups to reduce the burden of CVD.",

        "abstract": "Background Anemia due to living condition disproportionally affects the global refugee children. Nutritional deficiency particularly iron deficiency is the primary causes of anemia. Hence, we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of anemia among refugee children. Methods We searched systematically all relevant studies on the prevalence of anemia among refugee children including under the age of 18 years, which were conducted between 2009 and 2023 in English from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochran library and other gray literatures such as google scholar. Two researchers independently screened articles based on their title and abstract. The Joana Brigg’s Institute (JBI) checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. Random effect model was utilized to calculate the pooled estimate of anemia. Higgins I2 statistics and Egger’s test were analyzed to check heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. Subgroup analysis by continent, age group of the children and year of study was employed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Result A total of 14 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Most of the studies were from Asian countries followed by African countries. The pooled prevalence of anemia among global refugee children was 36.54 with (95% CI: 23.79, 49.28). There was moderate level of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 68.91, P<0.001). The highest pooled prevalence of anemia in refugee children was reported in African, it was 56.1%, whereas the lowest pooled prevalence of anemia was in N. America, it was 12.66%. The prevalence of anemia was highest (53.88) in studies done among under-five refugee children. Conclusion The global prevalence of anemia among refugee children is found to be moderate public health problem. Anemia prevalence is more common in African refugee children. Intervention and prevention for should be focused especially for refugees found in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "The article aims at conducting etymological analysis of the English terminology of cybersecurity which\nhas become topical under the conditions of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine and a growing cyberthreat\nto computer networks and applications all over the world. In spite of numerous works on the topic, there\nremains a range of uninvestigated issues concerning the origin of English cybersecurity terms. Cybersecurity\nis defi ned as measures to protect a person, organization or country and their computer information against\ncrime or attacks carried out using the Internet. 450 terms from the Glossary of Cyber Security Terms were\nanalyzed with a help of Online Etymology Dictionary. Methodology of investigation combines structural\nand etymological analyses. As a result of the structural analysis, the terms under study were subdivided into\none-component and multicomponent ones. It was found that three quarters of the studied terms appear to\nbe complex in their structure. The fi ndings of etymological analysis revealed that they are predominantly of\nLatin origin, while the second place among them is shared by the terms of a mixed Latin-Greek and English-\nLatin origin. They are followed in number by word-combinations of Latin origin with both Germanic roots\n(9.3%) and English proper elements (9.3%). The least represented appeared to be the terms of Greek-Italian\nand Greek-Arabic hybrid origin, as well as combinations of American English and Italian. The remaining\n106 one-component terms were also under consideration, among which the Latin-language term elements\nof the cybersecurity system prevail, making up a tenth part of the analyzed material. Other sources of the\nstudied terms (Greek, Dutch, Germanic, Old Norse, Celtic, African, Arabic, and blending) turned out to\nbe considerably less characteristic of the studied material and are represented by only 1–2% of examples\nincluding both direct and indirect borrowings. Thus, the vast majority of the terms studied (76%) are of\nmixed (Greek-Latin-Old English) origin, a tenth of each (10%) are terms of English proper and Germanic\nlanguages, as well as of Latin origin. In conclusion, the outcomes of etymological analysis revealed that\nEnglish terminology of cyber security is predominantly a hybrid mixture of classical Latin-Greek roots with\nEnglish elements.\nKey words: etymology, cybersecurity, terminology, Latin, Greek, one-component terms, multicomponent\nterms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To consolidate clinical trials that utilized the CRISPR technology to synthesise cures for various genetic diseases as a means to provide a window into the progress made so far while paving the way forward for future research and practices. Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023479511). Trials from seven databases’ (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Registry, ISRCTN registry, ICTRP/trialsearch.who.int, ChiCTR.org.cn, Clinical Trial Registry India, and Cochrane Library/Trials) inception to 9 March 2024, were considered. Exclusion criteria were unrelated, duplicated, non-English, unavailable full texts, diagnostic studies, correlational studies, observational studies, abstract-only papers, reviews or conference papers. Included studies were appraised using the ten-item CASP tool to assess methodological quality. The review identified 82 RCTs utilizing CRISPR and revealed four main themes: Diseases targeted, Countries of Clinical trials, Type of interventions, and Trial trends over the years. Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background The 42 days after delivery (“fourth trimester”) are a high-risk period for birthing individuals and newborns, especially those who are racially and ethnically marginalized due to structural racism. Objective To fill a gap in the critical “fourth trimester,” we developed 2 ruled-based chatbots—one for birthing individuals and one for newborn caregivers—that provided trusted information about postbirth warning signs and newborn care and connected patients with health care providers. Methods A total of 4370 individuals received the newborn chatbot outreach between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023, and 3497 individuals received the postpartum chatbot outreach between November 16, 2022, and December 31, 2023. We conducted surveys and interviews in English and Spanish to understand the acceptability and usability of the chatbot and identify areas for improvement. We sampled from hospital discharge lists that distributed the chatbot, stratified by prenatal care location, age, type of insurance, and racial and ethnic group. We analyzed quantitative results using descriptive analyses in SPSS (IBM Corp) and qualitative results using deductive coding in Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants). Results Overall, 2748 (63%) individuals opened the newborn chatbot messaging, and 2244 (64%) individuals opened the postpartum chatbot messaging. A total of 100 patients engaged with the chatbot and provided survey feedback; of those, 40% (n=40) identified as Black, 27% (n=27) identified as Hispanic/Latina, and 18% (n=18) completed the survey in Spanish. Payer distribution was 55% (n=55) for individuals with public insurance, 39% (n=39) for those with commercial insurance, and 2% (n=2) for uninsured individuals. The majority of surveyed participants indicated that chatbot messaging was timely and easy to use (n=80, 80%) and found the reminders to schedule the newborn visit (n=59, 59%) and postpartum visit (n=66, 66%) useful. Across 23 interviews (n=14, 61% Black; n=4, 17% Hispanic/Latina; n=2, 9% in Spanish; n=11, 48% public insurance), 78% (n=18) of interviewees engaged with the chatbot. Interviewees provided positive feedback on usability and content and recommendations for improving the outreach messages. Conclusions Chatbots are a promising strategy to reach birthing individuals and newborn caregivers with information about postpartum recovery and newborn care, but intentional outreach and engagement strategies are needed to optimize interaction. Future work should measure the chatbot’s impact on health outcomes and reduce disparities.",

        "title": "Anti-Black racism in Canadian health care: a qualitative study of diverse perceptions of racism and racial discrimination among Black adults in Montreal, Quebec",
        "abstract": "Background Racism has been shown to impact the health of Black persons through its influence on health care, including its expression through implicit biases in provider training, attitudes, and behaviours. Less is known about the experiences of racism in contexts outside of the USA, and how race and racism interact with other social locations and systems of discrimination to shape Black patients’ experiences of racism in health care encounters. To help address this gap, this study examined diverse Black individuals’ perceived experiences of, and attitudes towards, anti-Black racism and racial discrimination in Canadian health care, specifically in Montreal, Quebec. Methods This descriptive qualitative study adopted a social constructionist approach. Employing purposive maximal variation and snowball sampling strategies, eligible study participants were: self-identified Black persons aged 18 years and older who lived in Montreal during the COVID-19 pandemic, who could speak English or French, and who were registered with the Quebec medical insurance program. In-depth interviews were conducted, and a Framework Analysis approach guided the systematic exploration and interpretation of data using an intersectionality lens. Results We interviewed 32 participants, the majority of whom were women (59%), university educated (69%), and modestly comfortable financially (41%), but diverse in terms of age (22 to 79 years), country of origin, and self-defined ethnicity. We identified five major themes demonstrating substantial variations in perceived racism in health care that are influenced by unique social locations such as gender identity, age, and immigration history: (1) no perceptions of racism in health care, (2) ambiguous perceptions of racism in health care, (3) perceptions of overt interpersonal racism in health care, (4) perceptions of covert interpersonal racism in health care (including the downplaying of health concerns, stereotyping, and racial microaggressions), and (5) perceptions of systemic racism in health care. Conclusions Perceptions of anti-Black racism and racial discrimination in Canadian health care are complex and may include intra-racial group differences. This study begins to address the dearth of empirical research documenting experiences of anti-Black racism in health care in Quebec, highlighting a continued need for serious consideration of the ways in which racism may manifest in the province, as well as a need for anti-racist advocacy. Advancing racial health equity requires greater sensitivity from providers and decision makers to variations in Black patients’ health care experiences, towards ensuring that they have access to high quality and equitable health care services.

The results revealed: (1) Cultural Diversity & Ethnic minority psychology journal has published the most studies. The University of Michigan and University of California play the most important role in research related to black woman and social and racial discrimination. The USA is the main publishing country with significant academic influence. (2) Seanna Leath, Jioni A Lewis, J Camille Hall are the leading scholars in black women and social and racial discrimination. Regarding local impact per author, using the H-index, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Frontiers in Psychiatry appeared to be the most relevant.

        "abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tissue flossing on athletic performance measures. A secondary aim was to explore the efficacy of tissue flossing when applied to a joint or soft tissue (i.e., muscle belly) on athletic performance measures. An article search was completed in the PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and OneSearch electronic databases up to May 2024. Studies were included if they used tissue flossing as a primary intervention among healthy participants and used one or more athletic performance measures as an outcome. Exclusion criteria included studies that did not investigate tissue flossing on athletic performance measures among healthy participants, studies that used tissue flossing for blood flow restriction training, case studies, narrative reviews, dissertations, conference proceedings, and papers written in a language other than English. Eighteen articles and 559 total participants were included in the final analysis. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Downs and Black Checklist and the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. The major findings suggest that a single tissue flossing treatment ranging from 2 to 10 min that includes active single joint or active closed chain exercises may enhance post-intervention muscle strength, jump performance, and balance up to 45 to 60 min post-intervention. Tissue flossing to a joint or soft tissue both produced mixed results among studies, a definitive answer on which technique is superior cannot be determined at this time. Further direct comparison studies are needed for these two techniques.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Centralising prostate cancer surgical and radiotherapy services, requires some patients to travel longer to access treatment, but its impact on actual treatment utilisation and outcomes is unknown. Methods Using national cancer registry records linked to administrative hospital data, we identified all patients with high risk and locally advanced prostate cancer diagnosed between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 in the English National Health Service (n = 15,971). Estimated travel times from the patient residential areas to the nearest hospital providing surgery or radiotherapy were estimated for journeys by car and by public transport. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model relationships between travel time and receipt of care with adjustment for patient characteristics. Results 10,693 (67%) men received radical surgery or radiotherapy (RT) within 12 months of diagnosis. Average travel time to the nearest hospital providing prostatectomy or RT was 23.2 min by private car and 58.2 min by public transport. We found no association between travel time, either by car or public transport and the likelihood of receiving curative treatment. Patients living in the most socially deprived areas, those aged over 70, those with two or more comorbidities, and those of black ethnic origin, were less likely to receive curative treatment (p& =& 0.001 for all associations). Conclusions The current configuration of national prostate cancer services is not associated with the likelihood of receiving curative treatment. Further increases in capacity will unlikely improve utilisation rates beyond addressing sociodemographic barriers.",

        "title": "Differences in the Relationship Between Educational Attainment and Health Status Across Racial and Ethnic Groups in a Multi-ethnic United States Older Adult Population: A Cross-Sectional Electronic Health Record-Based Study",
        "abstract": "Introduction We aimed to describe the relationship of educational attainment with the prevalence of six health outcomes (ever and current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in an older adult population, including whether education-health relationships differed by health outcome, by racial and ethnic (racial/ethnic) group, and by racial/ethnic group within the same level of education. Methods This cross-sectional study used 2015-2016 electronic health record data for 149,417 non-Hispanic White (White), 15,398 African-American or other Black (Black), 15,319 Hispanic or Latino (Latino), 10,133 Filipino, and 8810 Chinese Northern California health plan members aged 65-79 years whose preferred language was English. For each racial/ethnic group, sex-specific age-standardized prevalence of the six health outcomes was estimated for four levels of education (non-high school graduate, high school graduate, some college, college graduate). Age-adjusted prevalence ratios were used to compare the prevalence between adjacent levels of education and at lower versus college graduate levels within racial/ethnic groups, and the prevalence between White adults and adults in the other racial/ethnic groups, within each level of education and overall. Results The education-health relationship varied across racial/ethnic groups and health outcomes, with gradient relationships more consistently seen for White, Black, and Latino older adults than Filipino and Chinese older adults. Even when a gradient relationship was not observed, the prevalence at the college graduate level was usually significantly lower than the prevalence at the three lower levels of education. The prevalence of current smoking, diabetes, and hypertension was higher among Black than White adults at most levels of education. Controlling for education level minimally affected comparisons of overall prevalence of health outcomes between adults in the White and the other racial/ethnic groups, with the broadest impact seen for Latino-White comparisons. Conclusions The relationship of level of education and health outcomes differs across racial/ethnic groups and by health outcome. This should be taken into consideration when using education as a risk adjustment factor or predictor of health outcomes in multi-ethnic older adult populations.",

        "abstract": "Background: Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness responsible for seasonal epidemics and with potential to cause pandemics. The decline in influenza-related studies published since 2018 resulted in data gaps, particularly in emerging markets. Methods: This systematic review searched for studies in six databases and gray literature sources to define the clinical burden of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILIs) and their associated sequelae among humans across emerging markets. Eligible studies were published in English, Spanish, or Chinese between January 2018 and September 2023 and conducted in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Results: In total, 256 articles were included, mostly on lab-confirmed influenza infections (n = 218). Incidences of lab-confirmed influenza cases in Asia (range 540–1279 cases/100,000 persons) and Sub-Saharan Africa (range 34,100–47,800 cases/100,000 persons) were higher compared to Latin America (range 0.7–112 cases/100,000 persons) and the Middle East and North Africa (range 0.1–10 cases/100,000 persons). Proportions of lab-confirmed influenza cases and influenza-associated outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, ICU admission and death) varied widely across regions. Temporal variation in influenza trend was observed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: In conclusion, influenza causes significant disease burden in emerging markets. Robust large real-world studies using a similar methodology are needed to have more accurate estimates and compare studies within age groups and regions. Continuous monitoring of influenza epidemiology is important to inform vaccine programs in emerging markets with heavy influenza disease burden.",

        "abstract": "A consistent pattern emerges where African American students’ scores lag behind their counterparts on both national and state literacy assessments. One possible explanation is rooted in the fact that approximately 80% of African American students speak African American English, which differs from the General American English, the language expected to be used within educational settings. African American English encompasses distinct phonological and grammatical (morphosyntactic) features compared to General American English. This paper aims to delineate the differences between these two languages, review research on African American English, and explore the prevalence of bidialectal or multidialectal abilities among African American students. Additionally, it will address research indicating that many teachers and teacher educators lack awareness of African American English, leading to a deficit-oriented perspective that views African American English as a linguistic deficiency rather than a linguistic difference.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Research output on climate change and human health is growing rapidly. This can make it difficult to find and use relevant information to develop public health action. Methods We present a global scoping review of the rapidly growing quantitative research output on long-term climate change and human health. We searched Scopus, Embase, and PubMed for quantitative, English language literature published between January 2000 and June 2021 that referenced climate change and human health in titles, abstracts, or keywords. Results From 36,956 publications we identified 754 relevant studies. Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific were studied much more often than other WHO regions. Research on temperature and vectors accounted for 70% of all included publications. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases were the most studied specific health outcomes. We found very few studies on non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Retrospective publications (153) showed effects of climate change are already occurring worldwide. Most studies on tick-borne encephalitis, malaria, and lower respiratory infections associated with air pollution found impacts caused by climate change have increased. The strongest attribution of climate change was found for heat-related impacts. In prospective publications (626) diarrheal diseases, and impacts associated with heat and chemical air pollution were most consistently projected to increase. Future vector-borne disease impacts were projected to be highly location specific. Some studies demonstrated adaptation can effectively reduce impacts, while noting that capacity to adapt differs greatly between population groups. Conclusions Our findings underline climate change impacts are diverse and complex. Future research should prioritize the relatively understudied regions most vulnerable to climate change, such as Africa, and impacts beyond those related to temperature and vector-borne diseases.",

We observe significant differences between socio-demographical groups in the sub-dimensions of the Adult Learner Self-Directedness Scale. The study advances a theory on adult learner self-directedness in ODeLHE contexts. Educators should consider learners’ support practices, particularly in the cases of women, Black Africans, and younger cohorts. ODeLHE practices should also consider learners’ high school grades and proficiency in English, their library access, number of modules they are enrolled in, and who they support financially as factors influencing their level of self-directedness. Such considerations can be used to address the need for the translation of knowledge into policies and activities that improve educational opportunities for students.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the most common hepatic condition globally. The prevalence of MASLD continues to increase, paralleling the consistent rising rates of risk factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Literature suggests that human immunodeficiency virus‐infected (HIV‐infected) individuals may have an increased risk of developing MASLD due to a complex interplay of factors including antiretroviral therapy. Since the development and widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV‐induced liver disease has continued to be the predominant cause of liver‐related morbidity and mortality. This protocol serves to narrate the methods that will be employed in conducting the published literature search for the systematic review and meta‐analysis which will report on the global prevalence of MASLD on people living with HIV and on ARV treatment. Methods The search of literature will be done using search engines or electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, African Journal Online, and ResearchGate. Specific keywords will be used to search literature that has reported on the prevalence of MASLD among HIV patients receiving antiretroviral treatment, this will ensure the reproducibility of the study. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal observational studies, retrospective cohort studies, clinical trial studies, meta‐analyses, and systematic reviews that were published in the English language from 1990 to 2024 will be included. Animal studies will be excluded. Three independent reviewers will conduct the selection process and select studies that meet the eligibility criteria. A quality assessment tool, Downs and Blacks will be used to assess the risk of bias of the selected studies. A review manager will be used for meta‐analysis of collected data and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool will assess the strength of evidence. Ethics, dissemination, and registration The review will not require ethical clearance as it will only include data that is publicly available in published reports. The results of this review will be disseminated through publications. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024516814).",

        "abstract": "Mechanical keyboards are one of the most used keyboards in daily work, and as the core component of a mechanical keyboard, keyswitches’ characteristics have been widely researched during the last several decades. Meanwhile, keyboards’ backlight design has become an emerging market trend, even though its actual influence on user experience remains unknown. Our study investigated the influence of keyboard switch characteristics and backlight states on typing performance and subjective typing experience. Thirty-three participants were involved in an English-language typing task on keyboards with four typical switches (red, black, brown, and blue types). Software was used to automatically record typing speed and accuracy, and a 7-point Likert subjective scale was used to evaluate typing experience. Results showed that tactile characteristics performed better than linear switches in typing speed, accuracy, and subjective refresh feeling in pair comparison of blue and red switches, and turning on the backlight effect improved typing speed, refreshing feeling, and pleasure. Among six physical characteristics of switches measured in the experiment, pre travel, reset travel, make force, and bottom force contributed more to better typing performance and subjective experience. Our findings provide keyboard manufacturers and researchers with a reference to optimize users’ typing experience.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective The economic crisis in Lebanon, which began in 2019, has affected the healthcare system and patients' incomes. The aim of this study was to analyze the obstacles faced by people with epilepsy (PWE) during this crisis and to assess its impact on their quality of life. Methods The method used was a cross‐sectional study conducted among PWE aged 18–65 years, who were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire covering sociodemographic aspects, clinical aspects, the impact of the economic crisis, and the QOLIE‐31 (version 1.0), validated in English and Arabic, which assesses the quality of life of PWE. Results 71 patients were included in the study with an average age of 35.2 years [23.5; 62.5] (53.5% were males). Their average QOLIE‐31 score was 50.3 (+/− 17.9). A significant proportion (71%) of patients reported difficulties during the crisis, with 25% reporting having had seizure‐related injuries in the years 2022–2023 and 36.6% reporting an increase in seizure frequency compared to that prior to 2020. Moreover, many patients had to change (33.8%) or discontinue (18.3%) antiseizure medications, due to drug shortages, rising costs, and high gas prices. To mitigate these challenges, patients sought solutions such as obtaining medications from abroad (34%) or through donations (8%) or purchasing from the black market (8%). Low quality of life was associated with unemployment, low education level, the presence of focal seizures with impaired awareness or generalized seizures, polytherapy, seizure‐related injuries, and medication changes during the economic crisis. Significance These results highlight the considerable challenges faced by PWE in Lebanon during the economic crisis, emphasizing the negative effect of the crisis on their quality of life and seizure control. Plain Language Summary This study analyzed the obstacles faced by 71 people with epilepsy during Lebanon's economic crisis and showed that many patients had to change (33.8%) or discontinue (18.3%) antiseizure medications, due to drug shortages, rising costs, and high gas prices. To mitigate these challenges, patients sought solutions such as obtaining medications from abroad (34%) or through donations (8%) or purchasing from the black market (8%). This affected their quality of life. In fact, low quality of life was associated with unemployment, low education level, focal seizures with impaired awareness or generalized seizures, polytherapy, seizure‐related injuries, and medication changes.",

These characters are ‘spectral’ in that they have no speaking part but appear briefly as attendants, servants, musicians, or indeed slaves. The article argues that their spectrality evokes the presence of Black African slaves in the Mediterranean, which has often been ignored in Early Modern Studies. However, through these characters Black slavery is turned into a mere spectacle, performed for the gaze of the theatre audience in early modern London.",

        "abstract": "\n The field of Atlantic history initially focused exclusively on the Anglo-American North Atlantic, largely ignoring the South Atlantic and Africa. This approach, dominant after World War II, portrayed a “Western civilization” based on North Atlantic liberal values, akin to a postwar Mediterranean. Over time, historians of the Anglo-American Atlantic criticized this narrow focus, recognizing the broader interconnectedness of the Atlantic world. Recent decades have seen a shift, with more historians acknowledging the Atlantic as a complex, interconnected space involving four continents. Particularly notable is the rise of studies on the South Atlantic, especially regarding science and empire in the Iberian world. These studies highlight the significant role of Spain and Portugal, challenging the previously North Atlantic-centered narrative.

        "title": "Characteristics of interventions that address racism in the United States and opportunities to integrate equity principles: a scoping review",
        "abstract": "Background As a driver of racial and health inequities, racism is deeply ingrained in the interconnected systems that affect health and well-being. Currently, no common frame is employed across researchers, interventionists, and funders to design, implement, and evaluate comprehensive interventions to address racism. Consequently, there is a need to examine the characteristics of interventions implemented in the United States that address racism across social and structural determinants of health and socio-ecological levels. Additionally, we utilized a Health Equity Action Research (HEART) framework to assess how interventions integrate equity principles. Methods This scoping review examined the characteristics of multi-level interventions that addressed racism and appraised the interventions using a Health Equity Action Research frame. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted across nine electronic databases between 24 October 2022 through 15 November 2022. Records were included if they were available in English, discussed or evaluated a multi-level intervention or program conducted in the United States, and discussed or evaluated the intervention or program regarding the health and well-being of racialized and ethnically minoritized groups. Results A total of 13,391 records were identified, of which 91 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Most records reported the racialized group impacted by an intervention, of which the majority were racialized as African American or Black (n = 42) and Hispanic or Latino/a/x (n = 18). Eighty-one (89%) of interventions reported health outcomes and concentrated on the individual level. Most funders reported across the records, and 86 (51%) were a federal agency or department. A further 43 (25%) were private foundations, 12 (7%) were nonprofit organizations, 10 (6%) were private universities, and 4 (2%) were public universities. Regarding alignment with the HEART framework, 14% of interventions reported a mixed-methods approach, 45% reported community engagement, and less than 1% reported researcher self-reflection. Conclusions Most interventions prioritized people who are racialized as Black and report health outcomes. Since intervention designs, objectives, and methodological approaches vary, no standard frame defines racism and health equity. Applying the HEART framework offers a standard approach for interventionists and researchers to examine power, integrate community voice, and self-reflect to advance health equity.

        "abstract": "Background Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has rapidly escalated over time, complicating treatment and increasing morbidity and mortality. Few studies have explored how the social determinants of health may be associated with patients’ risks for acquiring antibiotic-resistant (AR) uropathogens. Methods We identified urine cultures collected from outpatients presenting to Tufts Medical Center Primary Care Practices between 2015 and 2020. Specimens were included if patients’ age, sex, and residential address were recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) and if their urine culture yielded Enterococcus spp. or one or more gram-negative bacterial organism(s) or for which antibiotic susceptibility profiling and species identification was conducted. We abstracted patients’ sociodemographic characteristics from the EMR and used US Census Bureau data to identify characteristics about patients’ census tracts of residence. We evaluated associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics and patients’ risk of having a urine culture resistant to (1) three or more antibiotic classes (i.e., multidrug resistant [MDR]), (2) first-line treatments, (3) fluoroquinolones, (4) aminoglycosides, or (5) ceftriaxone using logistic regression models and a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple hypothesis testing. Results We included urine cultures from 1,306 unique outpatients, most of whom were female (89%). Patients largely self-identified as Non-Hispanic White (36%), Asian (15%), or Non-Hispanic Black (11%). Over 60% lived in an environmental justice-designated census tract. Most included isolates were Escherichia coli (76%) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). Using public insurance increased patients’ odds of having a uropathogen resistant to first-line antibiotics, but living in a limited-income neighborhood reduced patients’ odds of having a MDR uropathogen by 47%. We noted a strong but non-significant positive trend between speaking a language other than English and having an aminoglycoside-resistant uropathogen (p-value = 0.02). Most notably, after controlling for other factors, we observed no statistically significant associations between race or ethnicity and AR uropathogens. Conclusion The social determinants of health may play important and intersecting roles in determining a patient’s risk of having a resistant uropathogens that is more challenging or expensive to treat. It is crucial to acknowledge how race is likely to be a proxy for other factors affecting health, and to consider that some groups may be disproportionately impacted by antibiotic resistance.

        "abstract": "Background Persistent inequities in breast cancer outcomes exist. Understanding women’s experiences along the care pathway is the first step to finding solutions to tackle these inequities. Methods Secondary data analysis of the 2017/2018 English National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (n = 25,408) using logistic regression to explore inequities in care experience by sociodemographic factors (age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, sexual orientation) across 59 survey questions. We used the Candidacy Framework to interpret and organise our findings. Results Compared to older (65–74) and White British women, young (35-44, OR = 0.55 [0.44, 0.69]), Asian (OR = 0.52 [0.41, 0.67]), Black (OR = 0.67 [0.46, 0.97]) and White Other (OR = 0.63 [0.49, 0.81]) women were more likely to rate their overall care experience less positively, respectively. Similar findings were observed along all domains of the cancer pathway. Through a candidacy lens, we identified multilevel factors related to this variation including prolonged help-seeking behaviours (individual), poor patient-provider communication (interpersonal), and variation in access to healthcare professionals and resources (system level). Conclusion Multilevel factors influence inequities in the experience of care along the breast cancer pathway for young women and women from minoritised groups. Interventions are necessary to ensure cancer care systems are responsive to women’s health needs and provide equity of care to all patients.",

Official immigration records were linked with the Early Development Instrument assessments among children in kindergarten in the province of Manitoba, Canada (2005–2017). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of vulnerability in five developmental domains associated with maternal birthplace and child sex. Children of immigrant mothers from most birthplaces had higher adjusted odds of developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, except those of the rest of North America & Oceania. Children of Sub-Saharan African mothers were more vulnerable in four domains. Boys were consistently more vulnerable than girls across domains and maternal birthplaces. Children of immigrant mothers exhibited higher developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, potentially reflecting exposure to English and French as second languages.

        "title": "A transformer-based approach to Nigerian Pidgin text generation",
        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a transformer-based text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin also known as Naijá, a popular language in West Africa. Despite its wide use, Nigerian Pidgin remains under-resourced, particularly in areas related to text generation and natural language processing. These difficulties are primarily due to technological constraints rather than the language’s fundamental attributes. There is currently a demand for Nigerian Pidgin-specific solutions because it is used in everyday communication and has a unique linguistic blend. This paper aims to close this gap by exploring the application of state-of-the-art transformer technology to develop a text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin. This work uses the public Afriberta-corpus dataset to optimize the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) model across a sizeable dataset. The performance evaluators, BLEU and Perplexity metrics provide a detailed breakdown of the model’s text quality and predictive accuracy. Despite the difficulties caused by a limited amount of training data, preliminary evaluations show that the model can generate coherent Nigerian Pidgin text. The performance evaluation yielded perplexity scores of 43.56 for variable target reference length and 43.26 for fixed text length. BLEU scores of 0.15 for fixed max length and 0.56 for variable reference target length. This highlights the quality of generated text and the significant improvement when the generated text length is aligned with the reference target. Our work was benchmarked against African American Vernacular (AAVE) revealing that BLEU scores for AAVE are significantly lower than those for Standard American English, with BLEU given as 0.26. Our Nigerian Pidgin model, with a BLEU score of 0.56, shows a better performance. However, both results suggest that both dialects are challenging for language models. Leveraging the pre-trained transformer-based language model and evaluation metrics, we showcase the model’s capacity for coherent Nigerian Pidgin text generation. For future research, the research work can serve as a good foundation for advancement and progress in the Nigerian Pidgin language generation and other low-resource languages.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Estimates of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence and critically the amount of infection that is undiagnosed or unlinked to care are uncertain—even in countries like UK where vertical transmission and overall prevalence are very low. In the absence of country of birth data, we aim to estimate HBV prevalence through combining public health surveillance data on antenatally screened women by ethnic group and multipliers generated from non‐antenatally screened populations by ethnic group with English population denominators. Of 714,287 women aged 16–49 years with ethnic group data tested as part of antenatal care between 2015 and 2021, 4174 (0.6%) were HBsAg‐positive; 94% in people of ethnic groups other than White British. Of 1,447,467 people tested for HBsAg with ethnic group data from other testing sources (primary and secondary care excluding occupational health and renal services), 27,628 (1.9%) were HBsAg‐positive; 87% in people of ethnic groups other than White British. We estimate that the overall number and prevalence of people with chronic hepatitis B in England is 268,767 (95% CI: 227,896–314,044) and 0.58% (95% CI: 0.50–0.68). Approximately two‐thirds were male, one‐third female, and 68% were aged under 50. We estimate that over 83% of HBV infections are in people of ethnic groups other than White British, with 23% in people from Black ethnic groups, 21% from other White ethnic groups and 19% in Asian ethnic groups. These estimates are the first step towards establishing whether England can meet World Health Organisation targets to eliminate HBV as a public health problem—using methods that can also be used by other countries.",

        "abstract": "The increased quality and human-likeness of AI generated texts has resulted in a rising demand for neural text detectors, i.e. software that is able to detect whether a text was written by a human or generated by an AI. Such tools are often used in contexts where the use of AI is restricted or completely prohibited, e.g. in educational contexts. It is, therefore, important for the effectiveness of such tools that they are robust towards deliberate attempts to hide the fact that a text was generated by an AI. In this article, we investigate a broad range of adversarial attacks in English texts with six different neural text detectors, including commercial and research tools. While the results show that no detector is completely invulnerable to adversarial attacks, the latest generation of commercial detectors proved to be very robust and not significantly influenced by most of the evaluated attack strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients with diabetes experience worse health outcomes and greater health care expenditure. Improving diabetes outcomes requires involved self-management. Peer coaching programs can help patients engage in self-management while addressing individual and structural barriers. These peer coaching programs can be scaled with digital platforms to efficiently connect patients with peer supporters who can help with diabetes self-management. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a technology-enabled peer coaching intervention to support diabetes self-management among patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Methods MetroPlusHealth, a predominant Medicaid health maintenance organization based in New York City, partnered with Pyx Health to enroll 300 Medicaid patients with uncontrolled diabetes into its 6-month peer coaching intervention. Pyx Health peer coaches conduct at least 2 evidence-based and goal-oriented coaching sessions per month with their assigned patients. These sessions are focused on addressing both behavioral and social determinants of health (SDoH) with the goal of helping patients increase their diabetes self-management literacy, implement self-management behaviors, and reduce barriers to ongoing self-care. Data analyzed in this study included patient demographic data, clinical data (patient’s hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and program implementation data including types of behavioral determinants of health and SDoH reported by patients and types of interventions used by peer coaches. Results A total of 330 patients enrolled in the peer mentoring program and 2118 patients were considered to be on a waitlist group and used as a comparator. Patients who enrolled in the peer coaching program were older; more likely to be English speakers, female, and African American; and less likely to be White or Asian American or Pacific Islander than those in the waitlist condition, and had similar HbA1c laboratory results at baseline (intervention group 10.59 vs waitlist condition 10.62) Patients in the enrolled group had on average a –1.37 point reduction in the HbA1c score (n=70; pre: 10.99, post 9.62; P<.001), whereas patients in the waitlist group had a –0.16 reduction in the HbA1c score (n=207; pre 9.75, post 9.49; P<.001). Among a subsample of participants enrolled in the program with at least 2 HbA1c scores, we found that endorsement of emotional health issues (β=1.344; P=.04) and medication issues (β=1.36; P=.04) were significantly related to increases in HbA1c. Conclusions This analysis of a technology-enabled 1-on-1 peer coaching program showed improved HbA1c levels for program participants relative to nonprogram participants. Results suggested participants with emotional stressors and medication management issues had worse outcomes and many preferred to connect through phone calls versus an app. These findings support the effectiveness of digital programs with multimodal approaches that include human support for improving diabetes self-management in a typically marginalized population with significant SDoH barriers.",

        "abstract": "Rare diseases affect 6%-8% of the population and present diagnostic challenges, particularly for historically marginalized ethnic and racial groups. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) aims to enhance diagnosis rates and research participation among such minoritized groups. A retrospective review was conducted from 2015 to 2023, analyzing 2235 UDN participants to evaluate its progress toward this objective. Data on demographics, disease phenotypes, diagnostic outcomes, and socioeconomic factors were collected and statistical analyses assessed differences among ethnic and racial groups. This demonstrated that Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic groups were underrepresented, while White non-Hispanic participants were overrepresented in the UDN compared to the US population. Individuals whose primary language was not English were also significantly underrepresented. Diagnosis rates varied, with the highest rates among Asian non-Hispanic (39.5%) and Hispanic (35.3%) groups and the lowest rate in the White non-Hispanic group (26.8%) (p < 0.001). Binomial logistic regression found, however, that only participant age and disease phenotype predicted the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis (p < 0.001). Persistent ethnic and racial disparities in UDN participation appear to be associated with major differences in application rates. Under-enrollment of historically marginalized ethnic and racial groups may be due to economic hardships and language barriers. No differences in the diagnostic yield among ethnic and racial groups were observed after controlling for other factors. This work highlights the value of comprehensive genetic evaluations for addressing healthcare disparities and suggests priorities for advancing inclusion in rare disease research.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Although studies have evaluated the hospital cost of care associated with treating patients with COVID-19, there are no studies that compare the hospital cost of care among racial and ethnic groups based on detailed cost accounting data. The aims of this study were to provide a detailed description of the hospital costs of COVID-19 based on individual resources during the hospital stay and standardized costs that do not rely on inflation adjustment and evaluate the extent to which hospital total cost of care for patients with COVID-19 differs by race and ethnicity. Methods This study used electronic medical record data from an urban academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois USA. Hospital cost of care was calculated using accounting data representing the cost of the resources used to the hospital (i.e., cost to the hospital, not payments). A multivariable generalized linear model with a log link function and inverse gaussian distribution family was used to calculate the average marginal effect (AME) for Black, White, and Hispanic patients. A second regression model further compared Hispanic patients by preferred language (English versus Spanish). Results In our sample of 1,853 patients, the average adjusted cost of care was significantly lower for Black compared to White patients (AME = -$5,606; 95% confidence interval (CI), -$10,711 to -$501), and Hispanic patients had higher cost of care compared to White patients (AME = $8,539, 95% CI, $3,963 to $13,115). In addition, Hispanic patients who preferred Spanish had significantly higher cost than Hispanic patients who preferred English (AME = $11,866; 95% CI $5,302 to $18,431). Conclusion Total cost of care takes into account both the intensity of the treatment as well as the duration of the hospital stay. Thus, policy makers and health systems can use cost of care as a proxy for severity, especially when looking at the disparities among different race and ethnicity groups.",

        "title": "Exploring intersectional determinants of, and interventions for, low uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review protocol",
        "abstract": "Introduction Cervical cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in 36 low- and middle-income countries, with the majority located in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South America and Southeastern Asia. The highest regional incidence and mortality occur in SSA. Despite the high efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in preventing cervical cancer, its uptake remains unacceptably low in SSA. This scoping review aims to integrate evidence from SSA on social determinants of HPV vaccine uptake with complementary evidence on interventions to promote its uptake. Methods and analysis The proposed review will be conducted following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group. Additionally, a sequential explanatory design will guide the integration of determinant evidence with intervention evidence. This scoping review will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Six databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, LIVIVO, Google Scholar, BASE (Grey Literature), preprint databases (eg, OSF and medRxiv) and African Journals Online will be searched, with results limited to English language publications and those published from 2006 to 2024. Two forms will be used for data extraction from determinant and intervention studies by two independent reviewers. A narrative summary of evidence from both determinant and intervention studies will be conducted. Furthermore, a multilevel analysis will be conducted to explore the intersections of determinants across socioecological levels of health behaviour. A further integrative cross-study analysis of results from determinant and intervention studies will be conducted, where the determinant evidence will be used to interrogate the intervention evidence. Data will be presented in tables and matrices. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval will be required for this study because it will be based on data collected from publicly available records. The review results will be disseminated widely through a peer-reviewed publication and other forums such as workshops, conferences and meetings with local health administrators, policymakers and other wider stakeholder engagements.",

        "title": "Understanding the mechanisms of change in social norms around tobacco use: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of interventions",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Tobacco use spreads through social networks influencing social norms around tobacco use. However, the social norms scholarship is extremely diverse and occasionally conflicting, complicating efforts to understand how best to leverage social norms to reduce tobacco use. This study systematically reviewed and meta‐analyzed this vast terrain by focusing on social norms measurement and mechanism, and intervention effectiveness and modality aimed at changing social norms around tobacco use and actual tobacco use. Methods We searched Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo, Clinicaltrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations, the Cochrane Trial Registry, as well as the websites of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, the Open Science Framework, medrXiv and the Truth Initiative for experimental and quasi‐experimental evaluation studies of interventions designed to shift tobacco use. We included studies written in English from inception to 30 May 2024. We only included studies which noted social norms or social influence as part of the intervention design or set of measured variables. We excluded studies with only one time point, without an intervention being evaluated and those not published in English. Study screening followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and was conducted by at least two independent reviewers who resolved discrepancies through discussion and consensus. All included studies were analyzed in a narrative synthesis, and those providing sufficient statistics for tobacco and social norms outcomes were included in meta‐analyses, which were performed separately for tobacco outcomes and social norms outcomes. Study outcomes were transformed into a standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) and several meta‐regressions were fit to explore sources of heterogeneity using a robust variance estimation specification to handle effect size dependency. Results A total of 95 studies met inclusion criteria for the narrative synthesis, 200 effect sizes from 86 studies were included in the tobacco outcomes meta‐analysis, and 66 effect sizes from 29 studies were included in the social norms outcomes meta‐analysis. Nearly 90% of included studies were conducted in high‐income settings, with the remainder conducted in middle‐income settings. No studies were conducted in Latin America or on the African continent. Social norms change interventions had a statistically significant effect on reducing tobacco use and pro‐tobacco social normative perceptions [g = 0.233, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.166, 0.301, P < 0.001 and g = 0.292, 95% CI = 0.090, 0.494, P = 0.007, respectively]. Interventions were commonly conducted among schoolchildren in classrooms through multicomponent education sessions, often coupled with regular ‘booster' sessions over time. Among adult populations, motivational interviewing and other counselling approaches were used in some cases, and few interventions leveraged digital technologies to change social norms. Conclusions Social norms change interventions appear to be effective for reducing tobacco use and pro‐tobacco social normative perceptions. In particular, leveraging role models appears to be the most effective social norms change mechanisms for tobacco control.",

This paper draws on ethnographic data collected with working-class Black-British young people aged between 16 and 18. Through the careful management of identity and reputation, the young people in this paper negotiate affective struggles to attain and secure a high academic status within a deeply neoliberalised school context. The paper argues that the identity discourse of ‘Black excel-lence’ connects dimensions of class and race in the young people’s identity work. Black excellence is described as classed and racialised reflexivity which helped the young people pivot their identity as they sought to maximise their educational opportunities to transition into elite universities.",

        "abstract": "Background: The impact of clinical factors and social determinants of health on treatment patterns and health care costs among patients with HCC is unknown. Methods: Using 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service claims and a commercial multipayor claims database, we identified patients diagnosed with HCC from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. Surveillance receipt was defined 12 months prior to HCC diagnosis, whereas treatment and health care costs were assessed post-HCC diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between demographics, social determinants of health, and surveillance or HCC treatment. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to identify factors associated with total health care costs. Results: Of the 32,239 patients with HCC (mean age 68 y, 67% male, 73% White), 70% received surveillance and only half (51%) received any treatment. Curative treatment receipt was higher among those with prior surveillance (24% with CT/MRI and 18% with ultrasound vs. 9% with no surveillance). Curative treatment was independently associated with HCC surveillance and inversely associated with Black race, lower education level, and diagnosis in the year 2020 (COVID-19 year). Higher health care costs were independently associated with Black race, low English proficiency, living alone, and diagnosis in 2018–2020, and inversely associated with CT/MRI-based surveillance. Conclusions: Race and social determinants of health were independently associated with curative treatment receipt and health care costs. Increasing access to high-quality HCC surveillance may improve treatment receipt and reduce health disparities among patients with HCC.",

        "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent and costly condition globally, prompting the need to identify risk factors for effective management. Lower extremity misalignment plays a crucial role in the incidence of LBP. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the current evidence on a link between lower limb alignment and LBP, enhancing the understanding of this relationship. We searched four databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, up to September 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies related to LBP and lower limb alignment, with eligible study types including case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies, all written in English. Two authors independently screened and assessed the methodological quality of the retrieved papers using the Downs and Black quality assessment checklist. Data of interest including study design, age, sample size, cases, association, and P-value were extracted from the included studies. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with random effects model in RevMan version 5.4. Thirteen articles evaluating lower limb alignment in individuals with LBP were included (102,359 participants in total). The meta-analysis results demonstrated that increased pronation with strong evidence(p = 0.02), increased hip internal rotation with moderate evidence, and increased knee internal rotation with limited evidence are associated with an increased risk of LBP. Overall, while some studies supported a relationship between lower limb alignment and LBP, the heterogeneity of study designs and methodological limitations hindered drawing a definitive conclusion. Future research should emphasize prospective cohort studies, incorporating objective measures of lower extremity alignment and standardized outcome measures.",

        "abstract": "\n Several gaps remain in understanding individuals' water consumption reliance outcomes in disadvantaged communities. We utilize a cross-sectional sample of household-level survey data from predominantly low-income, minoritized households in Detroit, MI, to examine the relationship between tap and tap-alternative drinking water consumption and purchase behavior. We collected survey data from one English-speaking adult per household in May–October 2021 (n = 259). Consistent with past studies, tap water consumption is negatively correlated with single-use bottled water consumption and consuming drinking water from multiple sources. We also find tap distrust is correlated with tap-alternative water consumption, yet there is a surprising positive relationship between tap and overall bottled water consumption levels. Very low-income households were more likely to rely on bottled water and multiple other water sources simultaneously. Female respondents reported lower levels of most types of water consumption. Black respondents reported lower tap water and bottled water consumption but had higher levels of other tap-alternative source consumption. Our results call into question whether higher tap water consumption is synonymous with tap trust or with reduced bottled water consumption. Public health interventions must further address high levels of bottled water consumption among low-income individuals, and low tap water consumption among Black individuals.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Racial and ethnic healthcare disparities require innovative solutions. Patient portals enable online access to health records and clinician communication and are associated with improved health outcomes. Nevertheless, a digital divide in access to such portals persist, especially among people of minoritized race and non-English-speakers. This study assesses the impact of automatic enrollment (autoenrollment) on patient portal activation rates among adult patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), with a focus on disparities by race, ethnicity, and primary language. Materials and methods Starting March 2020, autoenrollment offers for patient portals were sent to UCSF adult patients aged 18 or older via text message. Analysis considered patient portal activation before and after the intervention, examining variations by race, ethnicity, and primary language. Descriptive statistics and an interrupted time series analysis were used to assess the intervention’s impact. Results Autoenrollment increased patient portal activation rates among all adult patients and patients of minoritized races saw greater increases in activation rates than White patients. While initially not statistically significant, by the end of the surveillance period, we observed statistically significant increases in activation rates in Latinx (3.5-fold, p = < 0.001), Black (3.2-fold, p = 0.003), and Asian (3.1-fold, p = 0.002) patient populations when compared with White patients. Increased activation rates over time in patients with a preferred language other than English (13-fold) were also statistically significant (p = < 0.001) when compared with the increase in English preferred language patients. Conclusion An organization-based workflow intervention that provided autoenrollment in patient portals via text message was associated with statistically significant mitigation of racial, ethnic, and language-based disparities in patient portal activation rates. Although promising, the autoenrollment intervention did not eliminate disparities in portal enrollment. More work must be done to close the digital divide in access to healthcare technology.

        "abstract": "In the summer of 2020, amidst state‐mandated social distancing and protests for racial justice, youth participating in an ongoing YPAR initiative sought to design and facilitate a book club for the residents of their subsidized housing community to increase community awareness of the Black Lives Matter movement. Through interviews, youth shared their plans to design and facilitate a book club differently than they had experienced in English classroom settings. Through the lenses of critical literacy and civic praxis, the youths' imaginings reveal a desire to talk about books that were relevant to their lives, involve discussions that were participant‐led and democratic, and lead to meaningful, tangible outcomes. Implications encourage teachers to re‐examine their classroom book club practices and consider ways to center student desires.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:\nLanguage is a powerful tool and means of communication and to communicate with others we also use other ways such as Body manners, gestures, signals and facial expressions which is also called as a non-verbal communication. English is a tool, like basic arithmetic, or literacy, or computer skills. An ability they need to master in order to function effectively in today’s world. The L1 remains the learners primary language and the only they identify with what teachers aiming for is functional English-knowing bilingualism.\nSocio-political status:\nWith the European trade patterns, most of the known European-based Creole languages were existed in the coastal regions of the Americas, Western Africa, Goa and along with the west coast of India. Indian Ocean Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from Malagasy and possibly other Asian languages.\nLearning Language Through Culture:\nLearning other language is to understand the nature of the relationship between language and culture, learners need to engage with the ways in which context affects what is communicated and how. \nStandard English is the variety of English that is generally acknowledged as the model for the speech and writing of educated speakers in UK. It is also associated with Received Pronunciation or accent.\nIntuitive acquisition: We learn anther language the same way as we learnt our first language or mother tongue. Intuitive acquisition through lots of exposure to the language in authentic communicative situations.\nHabit-formation: Language is a set of habits: we mimic and memorize and drill the patterns of the language until we learn to produce the correct forms automatically. \nCognitive Process: Language involves the understanding of underlying rules: if we master these rules, we will be able to apply them in different contexts. That may be at school, home, with community or with others. \nSkill-learning: Language is a skill. We learn it in school just as we learn other skills: someone explains rules or words to us, we understand and practice them until we master them and use them fluently and skillfully.",

        "abstract": "Black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) is one of the most popular berries in Russia. Its biochemical properties make it part of a healthy diet. This review describes the role of black currant and its by-products in the food industry and defines its nutritional value, i.e., vitamin C, anthocyanins, and dietary fiber. It covered original Russian and English research articles and reviews published in 2015-2023 and indexed in the Russian Research Citation Index or Pubmed databases. The keywords were black currant in Russian and English. \nBlack currant berries are rich in dietary fiber, polyphenolic compounds, anthocyanins, vitamin C, and potassium. They cover human needs for these nutrients. Added to fermented dairy and grain foods at 5-20%, fresh or processed berries fortify them with dietary fiber, vitamin C, and anthocyanins while reducing energy value. As ingredients with color, taste, and aromatic compounds, black currant berries and their secondary products can be introduced into the formulations of various alcoholic beverages. Berry pomace is a technologically functional ingredient with a moisture-retaining ability that increases the antioxidant capacity of the final product. Juice and aqueous extracts of black currant pomace are used as picklers for fish and meat products to increase their microbiological safety and shelf-life. \nComplex processing of black currant berries is feasible as they are a valuable source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and anthocyanins. Products of their processing provide a concentrate of dietary fiber with natural antioxidants. However, functional foods as sources of biologically active substances need to follow special criteria for fortified products. Black currant and its by-products are a potential source of valuable biologically active substances. In small quantities, they can expand the range of food products but fail to satisfy human diet with biologically active substances or reduce the overall energy value.",

        "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, disproportionately affects individuals with skin of colour (SOC), particularly African Americans. Despite the increased prevalence in SOC, racial minorities are underrepresented in HS clinical trials, limiting our understanding of treatment efficacy. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss the current literature regarding the clinical presentation, comorbidities, and management of HS in SOC individuals. A PubMed search was conducted using the terms Hidradenitis suppurativa, comorbidities, skin of colour, African–American, Hispanic, and quality of life with relevant studies written in English and pertaining to the demographics and clinical trials were included. African American patients with HS tend to experience more severe disease manifestations, higher rates of comorbidities like inflammatory bowel disease and anaemia, increased healthcare utilisation, and a greater likelihood of surgical interventions. While the current literature provides extensive information about African Americans regarding comorbidities and disease prevalence, there is a lack of research on Hispanic and other ethnic groups. For future research, it is important to broaden our focus to include various ethnic groups. Addressing these disparities requires focused interventions, inclusive clinical research initiatives, and healthcare policies tailored to the specific needs of patients with skin of colour.",

        "abstract": "Background: Closed, unstable AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fractures are common injuries with similar distributions by age, sex, and race. The purpose of this study was to identify disparities in access to and utilization of surgical care for these injuries. Methods: Ambulatory patients ≥18 years of age with capitated Medicaid health insurance who presented from January 2016 to February 2020 with an isolated, closed AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fracture with radiographic evidence of instability were retrospectively identified at 1 Level-I safety-net trauma center. Associations between patient characteristics (age, sex, preferred language, race, ethnicity, housing status, employment, and substance use) and measures of access to and utilization of ankle fracture surgery (days from injury to evaluation, being offered surgery, undergoing surgery, and days from evaluation to surgery) were investigated on bivariable and multivariable analysis. Results: Of the 1,116 patients who were screened, 323 met the inclusion criteria. The included patients had a median age of 41 years; 207 patients (64%) were male and 255 (79%) were Hispanic. Patients presented at a mean of 4.6 ± 7.0 days from injury. Delayed presentation was associated with self-identification as Hispanic (rate ratio [RR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17, 3.12]) and with marijuana use (RR, 1.59; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.36), whereas significantly earlier presentation was associated with a non-English language preference (RR, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.89), alcohol abuse (RR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.99), and illicit drug use (RR, 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.67). Ankle fracture surgery was offered to 274 patients (85%). Experiencing homelessness was associated with a decreased likelihood of being offered surgery (odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.69). Of patients who were offered surgery, 216 (79%) underwent surgery. Black patients underwent surgery significantly less frequently than patients who identified as White (OR, 0.14; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.77). The median time from evaluation to surgery was 11 days (interquartile range, 7 to 14 days). Patients who used illicit drugs experienced a mean delay to surgery of 6.0 days relative to those who did not use illicit drugs (mean time to surgery, 16.8 ± 7.1 and 10.8 ± 5.1 days, respectively). Conclusions: We identified disparities in access to and utilization of surgical care for unstable AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fractures that negatively affected patients with Medicaid insurance who identified as Hispanic or Black, were experiencing homelessness, or used illicit drugs. These disparities may negatively affect outcomes for patients receiving care in similar environments, such as capitated health-care networks and public safety-net health systems.

        "abstract": "Climate change, a significant factor in global health disparities, has been linked to numerous health issues, including oral health disorders such as dental caries and enamel hypoplasia. Sustainable Developmental Goal 13 (SDG 13) accentuates immediate action to battle climatic changes and their complications. This scoping review aimed to explore the existing evidence in the literature linking SDG 13 with Early Childhood Caries (ECC). The review was carried out following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A rigorous search was done during the month of May 2024 using databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar with search MeSH terms related to climate change, Early Childhood Caries (ECC), and Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG). Publications or abstracts were included only in English from 2015 onwards, with no restrictions on the type of study. A summary of the eligible studies was compiled, highlighting the countries where the research was conducted, the type of study designs used, the region, study aims, and key findings. Additionally, the study results were analyzed to determine whether SDG 13 was addressed. The initial search provided 74 articles, of which 51 were duplicates, yielding 23 for screening. After applying the eligibility criteria, seven studies were finally reviewed. Two of the seven studies included were from the African continent (Kenya and Nigeria), and one was a multi-centric study involving various continents, Africa (Nigeria & Kenya), Asia (Saudi Arabia, Indonesia), and America (Canada, Brazil). Two other studies were conducted in the UK, China, and India, while one was from the USA and focused on how climate change impacts dental caries. Only three studies were found to be addressing SDG 13. The review established a plausible link between ECC and climate change factors, addressing the need to incorporate sustainable developmental strategies and eco-friendly preventive measures in pediatric dentistry.",

Context: The increase in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use has been notable for widening disparities between the least and most socially marginalized. Given access barriers, there is limited CGM patient experience information that is inclusive of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus from socially marginalized backgrounds. Objective: To understand the CGM usage experience across a U.S. Medicaid population with type 2 diabetes at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured phone interviews with 28 English or Spanish speaking participants prescribed CGM who were enrolled in a U.S. Medicaid program that subsidized CGM. Audio-recordings of interviews were transcribed and analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. Results: Participants had a median age 56 (interquartile range 48-60) with varying levels of formal schooling (55% with 9 years or less) and were from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds (57% Hispanic, 18% non-Hispanic Black, 21% non-Hispanic White). Interviews were conducted in English (68%) or Spanish (32%). We identified six major themes: initial expectations and overcoming initiation barriers (subthemes: initial expectations, overcoming initiation barriers), convenience and ease promote daily use (subthemes: benefits over fingersticks), increased knowledge leads to improved self-management (subthemes: increased understanding and knowledge, glucose level self-awareness, motivating healthy behaviors), collaboration with provider and clinical team, improved self-reported outcomes (subthemes: improved glucose and non-glucose targets, positive emotional effect, essential for management), and barriers and burdens are generally tolerated (subthemes: barriers to monitoring, burden of self-monitoring). Conclusions: CGM was experienced as easy to understand and use and viewed as a tool for diabetes self-efficacy. Expanded CGM access for socially marginalized patients with type 2 diabetes can enhance diabetes self-management to help mitigate diabetes outcome disparities. Presentation: 6/2/2024",

        "abstract": "Abstract Disclosure: S.K. Majumdar: None. J. Sinard: None. The Hobnail subtype of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is reported to be a rare form of PTC that manifests with higher rates of extrathyroidal extension, metastases, disease recurrence, and mortality, when compared to classic PTC. We set out to characterize the clinical manifestations and initial pathologic findings of patients with PTC and hobnail histology at our institution. A retrospective search of pathology records from 1/2014 through 1/2024 was conducted to identify rare thyroid cancer variants including those with hobnail histology. An electronic medical record review was then performed to collect clinical information. The study was approved by our institutional IRB. A total of 15 patients with PTC of the hobnail subtype (≥ 30% features) or with hobnail features (< 30%) were identified: 8 hobnail subtype, 5 having hobnail features, 1 had hobnail and oncocytic features, 1 had hobnail and tall cell features. Sixty percent were female, mean age 50.6 years (SD 16.4), 67% white, 27% Hispanic, 6% black. Mean BMI was 29.4 kg/m^2 (SD 5.4), 33% had a history of prior or current smoking. Cancers were found incidentally in 33% of cases (3 after physical exam noting goiter or nodule), 53% presented with a newly noticed neck lesion, one of these presented with hoarseness and cough from tracheal invasion which was found later at surgery. Mean tumor size 2.65 cm (SD 1.7), 13 patients had 1 or more lymph nodes removed with at least one node being positive in 77% of cases. Rates of lymphatic invasion were 73% (33% extensive), vascular invasion 13%, and 13% had gross extrathyroidal extension. After initial surgery 60% had stage 1 disease, 27% stage 2, and 13% stage 3. One patient was changed to stage 4 upon the later discovery of lung metastases and this patient had 30% tall cell features on pathology. Three patients had T3 or T4 tumors, all of whom were from minority and vulnerable populations (2 non-English speaking Hispanic, 1 Black with mental illness), had significantly higher BMI than others (36.2 ± 4 vs 27.2 ± 4.5, p = 0.01), and tended to be older (67 ± 9.5 vs 46.5 ± 16, p = 0.057 ns). Long term follow up was limited since hobnail histology was only found in reports beginning in 2017 and became more frequent in 2022 and 2023. Although limited by case number, our findings show that patients who presented with the most advanced disease were from vulnerable populations, were older, and had higher BMI’s than those with lower stage disease. Also, coexistence of other variants, like tall cell changes, may impact presentation. Therefore, while PTC with hobnail histology is typically associated with more advanced disease presentations, psychosocial and other factors appeared to explain higher stage disease at presentation in our series.

        "abstract": "Patient portals allowing access to electronic health care records and services can inform and empower but may widen existing sociodemographic inequities. We aimed to describe associations between activation of a paediatric patient portal and patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and markers of previous engagement with health care. A retrospective single site cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine patient portal adoption amongst families of children receiving care for chronic or complex disorders within the United Kingdom. Descriptive and multivariable regression analysis was undertaken to describe associations between predictors (Race/Ethnicity, age, socio-economic deprivation status based on family residence, and previous non-attendance to outpatient consultations) and outcome. A sample of 3687 children, representative of the diverse ‘real world’ patient population, was identified. Of these 37% (1364) were from a White British background, 71% (2631) had English as the primary family spoken language (PSL), 14% (532) lived in areas of high deprivation, and 17% (643) had high (>33%) rates of non-attendance. The families of 73% (2682) had activated the portal. In adjusted analyses, English as a PSL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.95) and multi-morbidity (aOR 1.26, 1.22–1.30) was positively associated with portal activation, whilst families from British Black African backgrounds (aOR 0.68, 0.50–0.93), and those with high rates of non-attendance (aOR 0.48, 0.40–0.58) were less likely to use the portal. Family race/ethnicity and previous low engagement with health care services are potentially key drivers of widening inequity in access to health care following the implementation of patient portals, a digital health innovation intended to inform and empower. Health care providers should be aware that innovative human-driven engagement approaches, targeted towards previously underserved communities, are needed to ensure equitable access to high quality patient-centred care.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The Understanding America Study (UAS) is a probability-based Internet panel housed at the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California (USC). The UAS serves as a social and health sciences infrastructure for collecting data on the daily lives of US families and individuals. The collected information includes survey data, DNA from saliva samples, information from wearables, contextual and administrative linkages, ecological momentary assessments, self-recorded narratives and electronic records of financial transactions. The information collected focuses on a defining challenge of our time—identifying factors explaining racial, ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course, including racial discrimination, inequalities in access to education and healthcare, differences in physical, economic and social environments, and, more generally, the various opportunities and obstacles one encounters over the life course. The UAS infrastructure aims to optimise engagement with the wider research community both in data dissemination and in soliciting input on content and methods. To encourage input from the research community, we have reserved 100 000 min of survey time per year for outside researchers, who can propose to add survey questions four times a year. Participants The UAS currently comprises about 15 000 US residents (including a 3500-person California oversample) recruited by Address-Based Sampling and provided with Internet-enabled tablets if needed. Surveys are conducted in English and Spanish. Findings to date Since the founding of the UAS in 2014, we have conducted more than 600 surveys, including a sequence of surveys collecting biennial information on health and retirement (the complete Health and Retirement Study instrument), 11 cognitive assessments, personality, knowledge and use of information on Social Security programme rules, work disability and subjective well-being. Several hundreds of papers have been published based on the collected data in the UAS. Studies include documentations of the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how this varied across socioeconomic groups; comparisons of physical activity measured with accelerometers and by self-reports showing the dramatic biases in the latter; extensive studies have shown the power of using paradata in gauging cognitive change over time; several messaging experiments have shown the effectiveness of information provision on the quality of decision-making affecting well-being at older ages. Future plans The UAS national sample is planned to grow to 20 000 respondents by 2025, with subsamples of about 2500 African American, 2000 Asian and 3000 Hispanic participants and an oversample of rural areas. An increasing amount of non-interview data (contextual information, data from a suite of wearables and administrative linkages) is continually being added to the data files.",

Gharse: None. L. Collins: None. L. Aliaga: None. A. Millan Ferro: None. J. Cifuni: None. A. Schwartz: None. E. Kelley: None. C. Gomez: None. M. Aballay: None. Introduction: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glucose control in patients with diabetes, as demonstrated in clinical trials. There is limited information available on the real-world application of CGM adoption in a resource-limited setting or safety net outpatient hospital setting. This intervention's aim was to assess the impact of a multifaceted approach on improving CGM utilization and on glycemic control among patients with diabetes. Methods: Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, located in Brooklyn, NY is a resource-limited setting that in partnership with the Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA launched a CGM Clinical Care Optimization Program. This quality improvement (QI) initiative included establishing a diabetes technology team (DTT) which met weekly (n=24 sessions) to establish a highly specialized interprofessional group. The DTT activities included: 1) Establishing a CGM workflow; 2) Expanding Medical Assistant responsibilities related to diabetes technology and training; 3) Creating five bilingual (English-Spanish) patient handouts; 4) Building CGM vendor relationships; 5) Developing a CGM manual for data download, billing and coding, and education to increase CGM knowledge across the system. Data were collected prior to CGM initiation and at most recent visit. Results: The intervention occurred between February and November 2023. Prior to this intervention, 49 patients had a CGM prescription. After 9 months, CGM prescriptions were written for 333 patients (680% increase) with the following baseline characteristics (mean ± SD): age (61.2 ± 14.7 yrs.); 56% female; 44% male; 71% Latino; Race: 67% Other (63% Hispanic or Latino), 25% Black or African American, 4% White, Asian 2%, American Indian or Alaska Native 2%; 38% Spanish-speaking, 59% English-Speaking, 3% Other; 81% government insurance (63% Medicaid, 18% Medicare), 19% commercial insurance. The majority of patients had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (91%) and 9% had type 1 diabetes. Baseline HbA1C was 9.7 ± 1.5%. Of note, prior to CGM, 34% of patients had A1C>9%. The impact of CGM use was evaluated on 116 patients that met the following criteria: baseline A1C value within 60 days before or up-to 30 days after prescription, and a A1C >90 days after. After an average duration of 154 days of CGM use, HbA1c decreased significantly by -0.51% (p=0.001), demonstrating improved glycemic control post-CGM use. In those with A1c >9%, HbA1c decreased from 10.5% to 8.8% (p<0.01). Conclusion: Creating a CGM optimization program in a resource-limited setting is critical in improving patient self-awareness and provider insight in glycemic control in patients diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These data demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a CGM optimization program in a resource-limited setting, which is critically important in improving clinical care for people with diabetes.

        "title": "Early child development in England: cross-sectional analysis of ASQ®-3 records from the 2-2½-year universal health visiting review using national administrative data (Community Service Dataset, CSDS)",
        "abstract": "Introduction The Ages & Stages Questionnaire 3rd Edition (ASQ(R)-3) is a tool to measure developmental delay for children aged between 1 - 66 months originally developed in the United States. This measure has been collected in England since 2015 as a part of mandated 2-2[1/2]-year health visiting reviews and collated nationally in the Community Services Dataset (CSDS). CSDS is known to be incomplete and to-date there have not been any published analyses of ASQ(R)-3 held within CSDS. Objectives We aimed to a) identify a subset of complete child development data for children aged two in England using ASQ(R)-3 data in CSDS between 2018/19-2020/21; b) use this subset of data to analyse child development age 2-2[1/2] years in England. Methods We compared counts of ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS by local authority and financial quarter against national, publicly available health visiting metrics to identify local authorities with complete ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS. We described child development in this subset of the data using both a binary cut-off of whether a child reached expected level of development and the continuous ASQ(R)-3 score. Results Among the 226,505 children from 64 local authorities in our sample with complete ASQ(R)-3 records, 86.2% met expected level of development. Children from the most deprived neighbourhoods (82.6%), children recorded as Black (78.9%), and boys (81.7%) were less likely to meet expected level of development. Conclusions To fully understand child development in England, the completeness of ASQ(R)-3 data in the CSDS requires improvement. Second, to interpret the national CSDS data on child development, ASQ(R)-3 should be standardised and validated in an English context. Developmental support is needed for at least 13.8% of the children who did not meet the expected level of development, in particular children living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, those with Black ethnicity, and boys.

        "abstract": "Despite improvement in US healthcare, racial and ethnic minorities have experienced health disparities including sleep health disparities. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) from the earliest available date to September 2023 using the keywords sleep inequity, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Meta analysis, case reports, and editorials were also excluded. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the National Library of Medicine and Keywords were used to search PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. We also searched the reference lists of the selected articles. Using the search strategy, we identified 52 articles. After excluding 11 duplicate studies, we screened 41 articles. The studies not relevant to our search were further excluded and we finally assessed 16 full-text articles. Twelve of the 16 studies were cross sectional and 4 were prospective studies. Compared to Whites, increased prevalence of shorter sleep duration was found among people of diverse racial background. Similarly, individuals with lower socioeconomic status have been shown to have a disproportionate increase in insufficient sleep (1.62 times). Additionally, compared to White women, Black women were more likely to report short sleep (37% vs. 27%) and were less likely to obtain the recommended amount of sleep (52% vs. 64%). This review demonstrates disparities in sleep based on race/ethnicity as well as the effect of gender and socioeconomic status on the quality of sleep.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Informal caregivers provide care to older adults but report lack of preparedness to enact the role. Intervention programs delivered by distance offer one alternative to support preparedness. Three review studies conducted to date have highlighted the benefits of distance interventions for enhancing preparedness among informal caregivers of older adults. However, these reviews have been limited in presenting and discussing how intervention components influenced outcomes. Additionally, they have not compared different distance delivery approaches for informal caregivers of older adults or assessed their varying impact on preparedness outcomes. These limitations make the effectiveness of diverse distance approaches unclear. Aim To evaluate the effects of distance interventions aimed at enhancing preparedness among informal caregivers of older adults. Methods This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and is guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. It has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023400668). Databases used in the search will include CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ProQuest Theses and Dissertations Global. The search will not be restricted by publication year to include all relevant studies. Studies published in English and Portuguese will be included. Study quality will be assessed using Downs and Black’s checklist. If metanalysis is possible, it will be performed using the ReviewManager (RevMan) software. Conclusions The study will be the first of its type to systematically review and synthesize components and approaches of distance interventions aimed at supporting preparedness of informal caregivers of older adults.",

        "title": "Socioeconomic and ethnic disparities in preterm births in an English maternity setting: a population-based study of 1.3 million births",
        "abstract": "Background Preterm birth is a major cause of infant mortality and morbidity and accounts for 7–8% of births in the UK. It is more common in women from socially deprived areas and from minority ethnic groups, but the reasons for this disparity are poorly understood. To inform interventions to improve child survival and their quality of life, this study examined the socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in preterm births (< 37 weeks of gestation at birth) within Health Trusts in England. Methods This study investigated socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in preterm birth rates across the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The NHS in England can be split into different units known as Trusts. We visualised between-Trust differences in preterm birth rates. Health Trusts were classified into five groups based on their standard deviation (SD) variation from the average national preterm birth rate. We used modified Poisson regression to compute risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with generalised estimating equations. Results The preterm birth rate ranged from 6.8/100 births for women living in the least deprived areas to 8.8/100 births for those living in the most deprived areas. Similarly, the preterm birth rate ranged from 7.8/100 births for white women, up to 8.6/100 births for black women. Some Health Trusts had lower than average preterm birth rates in white women whilst concurrently having higher than average preterm birth rates in black and Asian women. The risk of preterm birth was higher for women living in the most deprived areas and ethnicity (Asian). Conclusions There was evidence of variation in rates of preterm birth by ethnic group, with some Trusts reporting below average rates in white ethnic groups whilst concurrently reporting well above average rates for women from Asian or black ethnic groups. The risk of preterm birth varied substantially at the intersectionality of maternal ethnicity and the level of socioeconomic deprivation of their residency. In the absence of other explanations, these findings suggest that even within the same Health Trust, maternity care may vary depending on the women’s ethnicity and/or whether she lives in an area of high socioeconomic deprivation. Thus, social factors are likely key determinants of inequality in preterm birth rather than provision of maternity care alone.

        "title": "Emergency Department Food Insecurity Screening, Food Voucher Distribution and Utilization: A Prospective Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Objective Food insecurity is a prevalent social risk among emergency department (ED) patients. Patients who may benefit from food insecurity resources may be identified via ED-based screening; however, many patients experience difficulty accessing resources after discharge. Co-locating resources in or near the ED may improve utilization by patients, but this approach remains largely unstudied. This study characterized the acceptance and use of a food voucher redeemable at a hospital food market for patients who screened positive for food insecurity during their ED visit. Methods This prospective cohort study, conducted at a single county-funded ED, included consecutive adult patients who presented on weekdays between 8 am–8 pm from July–October 2022 and consented to research participation. We excluded patients who required resuscitation on arrival or could not provide written informed consent in English. Study participants completed a paper version of the two-question Hunger Vital Sign screening tool, administered by research staff. Participants who screened positive received a uniquely numbered $30 food voucher redeemable at the hospital’s co-located food market. Voucher redemption was quantified through regular evaluation of market receipt records at 30-day intervals. The primary outcome was the proportion of redeemed vouchers. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants screening positive for food insecurity, proportion of participants accepting vouchers, and associated descriptive statistics. Results Of the 396 eligible individuals approached, 377 (95.2%) consented and completed food insecurity screening. Most were middle-aged (median 53 years, interquartile range 30–58 years), 191 were female (50.4%), 242 were Black (63.9%), and 343 were non-Hispanic (91.0%). Of the participants, 228 (60.2%) screened positive for food insecurity and 224 received vouchers (98.2%), of which 86 were redeemed (38.4%) a median of nine days after the ED visit. Conclusion A high proportion of participants screened positive for food insecurity and accepted food vouchers; however, less than half of all vouchers were redeemed at the co-located food market. These results imply ED food voucher distribution for food insecurity is feasible, but co-location of resources alone may be insufficient in addressing the social risk and alludes to a limited understanding of facilitators and barriers to resource utilization following ED-based social needs screening.",

In this pre-registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42022372538), we evaluated and synthesized the available literature reporting the use of CAT as a diagnostic, treatment and mental health promotion intervention with adolescent refugees, aged 10-24 years.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nWe conducted a systematic search of the grey and black literature published in English and Arabic between 2012 to 2022 on 10 databases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSystematic database searches revealed 397 articles but only 5 met our inclusion criteria. These studies reported some positive outcomes but the evidence supporting the effectiveness of CAT as a diagnostic, treatment and mental health promotion intervention with adolescent refugees, aged 10-24 years is inconclusive.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings of this review point to the need for more methodologically robust studies that describe the intervention, implementation, and therapeutic approaches in greater detail to strengthen the evidence for the use of CAT with adolescent refugees.",

Design National cohort study. Setting All English National Health Service hospitals. Population A total of 6 192 140 women who gave birth in English NHS hospitals from April 2007 to March 2017. Methods Statistical analysis using birth and readmission data from routinely collected National Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. Main Outcome Measures Rate of emergency postnatal maternal hospital readmissions related to pregnancy or giving birth within 42 days postpartum, readmission diagnoses and association with maternal demographic factors, obstetric risk factors and postnatal LOS. Results A significant increase in the rate of emergency postnatal maternal readmissions from 15 128 (2.5%) in 2008 to 20 734 (3.4%) in 2016 (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.28–1.37) was found. Risk factors for readmission included minoritised ethnicity (particularly Black or Black British ethnicity: aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31–1.39); age < 20 years (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.12); 40+ years (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.10); primiparity (multiparity: aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91–0.93); nonspontaneous vaginal birth modes (emergency caesarean: aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.82–1.90); longer LOS (4+ vs. 0 days: aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.53–1.64); and obstetric risk factors including urinary retention (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 2.06–2.53) and postnatal wound breakdown (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.83–2.21). Conclusions The concerning rise in emergency maternal readmissions should be addressed from a health inequalities perspective focusing on women from minoritised ethnic groups; those < 20 and ≥ 40 years old; primiparous women; and those with specified obstetric risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are experts in communication and swallowing who work with individuals across the lifespan. Prior demographic surveys in English-speaking countries (e.g., Canada and the United States) suggest that SLPs gender, racial, linguistic, and cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds may not be aligned with those of their clientele. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic characteristics of current SLP students, to gauge whether the demographic composition of future clinicians is changing and is aligned with the population they are trained to serve. We designed an anonymous online survey, in the Canadian context, that enabled us to compare current SLP student demographics with statistics available about the target population at large. This survey was disseminated to all SLP students enrolled in an accredited institution in 2024. Participants answered questions about their age, sex and gender, linguistic, racial and cultural identities, and socioeconomic status. More than half (N=525, 53%) of currently enrolled SLP students completed the survey. Results indicate that SLP students are overwhelmingly cisgender females. SLP students spoke 48 unique languages, and while most were bi or multilingual, few felt competent enough in languages other than English and French to engage in clinical service delivery. There were 151 unique racial and ethnic identities reported, with the largest proportion of students identifying as 'North American.' Culturally most SLPs identified as 'Canadian.' Very few students identified as Black or Indigenous racially or culturally. Most respondents reported a higher-than-average total household income. Findings suggest that the demographic composition of current SLP students is more diverse than those currently practicing, however there is still over-, and underrepresentation of certain populations. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "\n \n There is a wide gap in judo participation between developing and developed countries. In South Africa (SA), there are only 2139 (0.00004% of the population) registered judokas compared to 122 000 (0,001% of the population) in Japan. This may be attributed to the fact that in developing countries such as SA, judo participation is dominated by a single race, generally the white race.\n \n \n \n This disjuncture is said to be informed by a combination of factors, including affordability, preferences, and the legacy of apartheid. Interestingly, despite being a popular sport amongst the white population in SA, judo is practiced by more black people than whites in some provinces, namely, the Eastern and Western Cape. The purpose of the research is to reflect on how judo has navigated, and migrated to its current form and what the future holds. A substantial literature search was done using PubMed, SCOPUS, SportDiscuss, Google Scholar, and Web of Science (2001 - June 2020). The synthesis of the literature suggests that the management of judo requires more than just financial resources; it also needs a well-defined organizational strategy.\n \n \n \n This study used 65 full-text English-language papers from 90 citations found through electronic searches. After removing duplicates and reviewing the full-text versions, 18 articles remained central to athlete success in the professionalization of federations. Federations that are run on a voluntary basis are seen as inefficient and unsustainable to successfully plan an athlete’s international success pathway.\n \n \n \n Furthermore, there is a consensus amongst researcher’s that professionalism and commercialization are central to improving athlete’s performance, participation, and efficacy in the athlete’s management system. Evidently, financial resources, a clear long-term plan and full-time coaching and administration staff play a critical role in the successful management of any Federation.\n",

        "abstract": "Background: Alopecic sarcoidosis is an uncommon cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. Scarring and nonscarring alopecic sarcoidosis have been reported; however, information on the epidemiology, systemic disease associations, and treatment efficacy is limited. Objective: To address these gaps, we conducted a retrospective chart review and systematic literature review of alopecic sarcoidosis cases. Methods: Full-text English publications from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to August 2023 were analyzed. Treatment evidence quality was assessed using the modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine rating scale. Three patients with biopsy-proven alopecic sarcoidosis were included as a case series, all demonstrating systemic sarcoidosis and 2 requiring multiple therapies. Among 1778 search results, 60 articles representing 77 cases of alopecic and scalp sarcoidosis were included. Patients were categorized into 4 distinct alopecic subgroups. Black patients constituted the majority of all subgroups. Results: Extracutaneous sarcoidosis burden was high across all alopecic subgroups, with ocular disease appearing overrepresented. Topical and oral corticosteroids were the main treatments. Though scarring alopecia patients had poor outcomes despite receiving immunomodulators/cx, limited data suggest potential efficacy of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Limitations: This study has a small sample size. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of evidence-based strategies for improving alopecic sarcoidosis management. Prompt diagnosis and systemic evaluation, especially for scarring alopecia, are essential for timely intervention to optimize patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Although racially and ethnically minoritized populations are less likely to participate in cancer trials, it is unknown whether social determinants of health (SDOH) explain these inequities. Here we identify SDOH factors that contribute to racial and ethnic inequities in clinical trial participation among patients with 22 common cancers. Methods This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data (2011-2023) linked to neighborhood (US Census tract) data from multiple sources. Patients were followed from diagnosis to clinical study drug receipt (proxy for trial participation), death, or last recorded activity. Associations were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical factors (year of diagnosis, age, sex, performance status, disease stage, cancer type). To elucidate which area-level SDOH underlie racial and ethnic inequities, mediation analysis was performed using nonlinear multiple additive regression tree models. Results This study included 250 105 patients (64.7% non-Latinx White, 8.9% non-Latinx Black, 5.2% Latinx). Black and Latinx patients were more likely to live in economically or socially marginalized areas (eg, disproportionately minoritized [measure of segregation], limited English proficiency, low vehicle ownership) than White patients. Black (3.7%; hazard ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 0.60) and Latinx patients (4.4%; hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.69) were less likely to participate in trials than White patients (6.3%). Fewer patients in economically or socially marginalized neighborhoods participated in trials. Mediators explained 62.2% (95% CI = 49.5% to 74.8%) of participation inequities between Black and White patients; area-level SDOH—including segregation (29.9%, 95% CI = 21.2% to 38.6%) and vehicle ownership (11.6%, 95% CI = 7.0% to 16.1%)—were the most important mediators. Similarly, Latinx-White participation inequities were mediated (65.1%, 95% CI = 49.8% to 80.3%) by area-level SDOH, such as segregation (39.8%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 51.3%), limited English proficiency (11.6%, 95% CI = 2.8% to 20.4%), and vehicle ownership (9.6%, 95% CI = 5.8% to 13.5%). Conclusions To improve racial and ethnic diversity in cancer trials, efforts to address barriers related to adverse neighborhood SDOH factors are necessary.",

        "abstract": "We analyze Asian American comedian Ali Wong's linguistic and embodied performance in her 2016 stand‐up special, Baby Cobra, through a genre‐specific lens to investigate how stand‐up comedy's performance conventions shape her comedic persona. We argue that Wong uses communicative forms indexically associated with Blackness to perform racialized and gendered figures of personhood, including the white “Karen,” “sassy Black woman,” and “Asian grandmother.” This performance allows Wong to challenge hegemonic whiteness and dominant racializations of Asian women but relies on signs potentially interpreted as reproducing anti‐Black ideologies. We situate Wong as an individual performer, “Asian American” as an ethnoracial category vis‐à‐vis Blackness, and the linguistic practices of Asian and Black American communities within racial capitalist histories that have shaped contemporary raciolinguistic ideologies. Rather than approach language varieties and racialized groups as necessarily distinct, we treat them as relational—as necessarily intimately and historically connected.",

        "abstract": "Background Cannabis is the most common illicit substance used in pregnancy. As use continues to increase, understanding peoples’ behaviors surrounding cannabis use during pregnancy is needed to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The aim of this study was to better understand pregnant individuals' perceptions and knowledge of cannabis use and use patterns as well as the social and environmental factors that may influence their use. Methods We conducted interviews with 19 participants between December 2022 and March 2023. Individuals self-identified as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), were over 21 years of age, spoke English or Spanish, resided in California, and had used cannabis during pregnancy in the last 0–2 years. Using qualitative, constructivist grounded theory methods, we analyzed the contexts that contributed to participants’ lived experiences surrounding cannabis use behaviors during pregnancy. Results Participants reported making conscious decisions to responsibly manage their cannabis use during pregnancy to minimize potential harm to the fetus. Participants prioritized making what they perceived to be safer adjustments to their use of cannabis: (1) changing the amount of cannabis used, (2) changing the types of cannabis products used, and (3) changing sources of cannabis procurement. Discussion Our findings show that pregnant individuals are seeking information about safe cannabis use beyond medical supervision and are open to altering their cannabis consumption patterns. However, they are unable to find trustworthy and evidence-based harm reduction practices which can be implemented to mitigate harm to their unborn children. A harm reduction approach is needed in the field of maternal cannabis use to promote positive maternal and fetal health outcomes. Conclusions More data is needed on comprehensive harm reduction approaches to cannabis use during pregnancy. This requires implementation of education on these topics in healthcare settings presented by prenatal care clinicians.

        "abstract": "The effect of public pre-kindergarten (pre-K) on the short-term outcomes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds is well established; however, the mechanisms for this effect are not well understood. Of the many factors that influence how pre-K participants progress during and after kindergarten, one understudied factor is the effect of pre-K participation on kindergarten attendance. The effects of absenteeism are cumulative, and habits established early in the school years are likely to affect later school outcomes. Thus, if pre-K improves kindergarten attendance, participants may be poised for later school success. To begin to test this hypothesis, we conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine the kindergarten readiness of 19,490 children and attendance records of 39,113 children who either were enrolled in Michigan’s Great Start Readiness Program (GSRP) or were placed on waitlists because their GSRP sites were full. Using variants of multilevel modeling, we found, as expected, that GSRP children performed better than waitlisted children on the Kindergarten Readiness Assessment. Examination of kindergarten attendance records found that waitlisted children were more likely to be absent than their counterparts who participated in GSRP, with particularly strong effects for children who were Black, economically disadvantaged, or English Language Learners.",

        "abstract": "We examined the longitudinal psychometric properties of the Perceived Stress Scale - 4 items version (PSS-4) using item response theory with a sample of 361 mental health counsellors. Participants completed the PSS-4 at three timepoints at six-month intervals in a one-year period. There were 290 participants who (80.3%) identified as female, 51 (14.1%) identified as male, eight (2.2%) identified as gender variant/non-conforming, seven (1.9%) wrote in their own gender identity (e.g., genderqueer, gender expansive), three (0.8%) identified as Transgender male, and two (0.6%) did not respond to the item. The racial and ethnic backgrounds were as follows: White (87.3%), Multiracial (5.5%), Latino or Hispanic or Spanish (2.8%), Black or African American (1.4%), Asian (0.8%), Middle Eastern (0.8%), and five did not respond to the item (1.4%). We found unidimensionality evidence of the PSS-4 across all three timepoints and response categories were monotonically ordered. We also found that across all timepoints, the average person location was lower than the average item location, suggesting that the PSS-4 may not be well-targeted for this sample of mental health counsellors. We observed no significant interactions between timepoints, hours worked per week, and length of employment.

        "abstract": "\n Fish spawning aggregations are vulnerable to overexploitation, which can have severe ecological, social, and economic consequences. Knowledge on the spatial ecology of aggregating species is often lacking, but is crucial for their effective conservation. This study explores the spawning site residency, interannual fidelity, and migration of black seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus using acoustic (n = 55) and conventional (n = 2397) tagging within and outside Marine Conservation Zones in the southern UK. Detections and recaptures of tagged fish indicated that black seabream display significant interannual fidelity to nesting areas, but that residency of individuals at nesting areas was short relative to current temporal management of these areas. Locations of detection and recapture during autumn/winter indicated migration by black seabream into deeper waters of the English Channel and coastal waters of France and the Channel Islands. The results indicate spatial structuring of black seabream populations maintained by homing of adults to previously occupied sites. However, short residency periods within protected reproductive sites, and evidence of transboundary migrations emphasize the importance of effective fisheries management, i.e. collaborative between European nations. These findings highlight the importance of international-scale telemetry studies and networks for informing ecosystem-based fisheries management of sensitive migratory species.",

Study quality and confidence in findings were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) approach. Of 15025 papers screened, 45 were eligible for inclusion. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Women reported depression stemming from racial and gender-related stressors, social isolation, and a loss of faith; moreover, the Strong Black Woman schema masked depression symptoms. Mistrust of healthcare providers, stigma, religious coping, and pressure to conform to the Strong Black Woman schema hindered healthcare service utilisation. The rapport between women and their healthcare providers, endorsement from faith leaders, and points of crisis enabled service utilisation. Lived experience experts provided reflections and recommendations for practice.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nIncreasing numbers of unaffected individuals could benefit from genetic evaluation for inherited cancer susceptibility. Automated conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are being developed for cancer genetics contexts; however, randomized comparisons with standard of care (SOC) are needed.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine whether chatbot and SOC approaches are equivalent in completion of pretest cancer genetic services and genetic testing.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis equivalence trial (Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services [BRIDGE] randomized clinical trial) was conducted between August 15, 2020, and August 31, 2023, at 2 US health care systems (University of Utah Health and NYU Langone Health). Participants were aged 25 to 60 years, had had a primary care visit in the previous 3 years, were eligible for cancer genetic evaluation, were English or Spanish speaking, had no prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, had no prior cancer genetic counseling or testing, and had an electronic patient portal account.\n\n\nIntervention\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 at the patient level to the study groups at each site. In the chatbot intervention group, patients were invited in a patient portal outreach message to complete a pretest genetics education chat. In the enhanced SOC control group, patients were invited to complete an SOC pretest appointment with a certified genetic counselor.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPrimary outcomes were completion of pretest cancer genetic services (ie, pretest genetics education chat or pretest genetic counseling appointment) and completion of genetic testing. Equivalence hypothesis testing was used to compare the study groups.\n\n\nResults\nThis study included 3073 patients (1554 in the chatbot group and 1519 in the enhanced SOC control group). Their mean (SD) age at outreach was 43.8 (9.9) years, and most (2233 of 3063 [72.9%]) were women. A total of 204 patients (7.3%) were Black, 317 (11.4%) were Latinx, and 2094 (75.0%) were White. The estimated percentage point difference for completion of pretest cancer genetic services between groups was 2.0 (95% CI, -1.1 to 5.0). The estimated percentage point difference for completion of genetic testing was -1.3 (95% CI, -3.7 to 1.1). Analyses suggested equivalence in the primary outcomes.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThe findings of the BRIDGE equivalence trial support the use of chatbot approaches to offer cancer genetic services. Chatbot tools can be a key component of sustainable and scalable population health management strategies to enhance access to cancer genetic services.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03985852.",

        "abstract": "Background Research is needed to understand and address barriers to risk management for women at high (≥20% lifetime) risk for breast cancer, but recruiting this population for research studies is challenging. Objective This paper compares a variety of recruitment strategies used for a cross-sectional, observational study of high-risk women. Methods Eligible participants were assigned female at birth, aged 25-85 years, English-speaking, living in the United States, and at high risk for breast cancer as defined by the American College of Radiology. Individuals were excluded if they had a personal history of breast cancer, prior bilateral mastectomy, medical contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging, or were not up-to-date on screening mammography per American College of Radiology guidelines. Participants were recruited from August 2020 to January 2021 using the following mechanisms: targeted Facebook advertisements, Twitter posts, ResearchMatch (a web-based research recruitment database), community partner promotions, paper flyers, and community outreach events. Interested individuals were directed to a secure website with eligibility screening questions. Participants self-reported method of recruitment during the eligibility screening. For each recruitment strategy, we calculated the rate of eligible respondents and completed surveys, costs per eligible participant, and participant demographics. Results We received 1566 unique responses to the eligibility screener. Participants most often reported recruitment via Facebook advertisements (724/1566, 46%) and ResearchMatch (646/1566, 41%). Community partner promotions resulted in the highest proportion of eligible respondents (24/46, 52%), while ResearchMatch had the lowest proportion of eligible respondents (73/646, 11%). Word of mouth was the most cost-effective recruitment strategy (US $4.66 per completed survey response) and paper flyers were the least cost-effective (US $1448.13 per completed survey response). The demographic characteristics of eligible respondents varied by recruitment strategy: Twitter posts and community outreach events resulted in the highest proportion of Hispanic or Latina women (1/4, 25% and 2/6, 33%, respectively), and community partner promotions resulted in the highest proportion of non-Hispanic Black women (4/24, 17%). Conclusions Although recruitment strategies varied in their yield of study participants, results overall support the feasibility of identifying and recruiting women at high risk for breast cancer outside of clinical settings. Researchers must balance the associated costs and participant yield of various recruitment strategies in planning future studies focused on high-risk women.",

Participant-level data included surveys and HbA1c collection. Center-level data included Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set metrics. Demographic characteristics were summarized overall and stratified by state (frequencies, percentages, means (95% CIs)). Generalized linear mixed models were used to compute and compare model-estimated rates and means. Results Participant-level cohort: 582 adults with diabetes were recruited (33.0% type 1 diabetes (T1D), 67.0% type 2 diabetes (T2D)). Mean age was 51.1 years (95% CI 49.5, 52.6); 80.7% publicly insured or uninsured; 43.7% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 31.6% Hispanic, 7.9% non-Hispanic black (NHB) and 16.8% other. Center-level cohort: 32 796 adults with diabetes were represented (3.4% with T1D, 96.6% with T2D; 72.7% publicly insured or uninsured). Florida had higher rates of uninsured (p<0.0001), lower continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use (18.3% Florida; 35.9% California, p<0.0001), and pump use (10.2% Florida; 26.5% California, p<0.0001), and higher proportions of people with T1D/T2D>9% HbA1c (p<0.001). Risk was stratified within states with NHB participants having higher HbA1c (mean 9.5 (95% CI 8.9, 10.0) compared with NHW with a mean of 8.4 (95% CI 7.8, 9.0), p=0.0058), lower pump use (p=0.0426) and CGM use (p=0.0192). People who prefer to speak English were more likely to use a CGM (p=0.0386). Conclusions Characteristics of medically underserved communities with diabetes vary by state and by race and ethnicity. Florida’s lack of Medicaid expansion could be a factor in worsened risks for vulnerable communities with diabetes.",

        "title": "A Cluster-Randomized Study of Technology-Assisted Health Coaching for Weight Management in Primary Care",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE We undertook a trial to test the efficacy of a technology-assisted health coaching intervention for weight management, called Goals for Eating and Moving (GEM), within primary care. METHODS This cluster-randomized controlled trial enrolled 19 primary care teams with 63 clinicians; 9 teams were randomized to GEM and 10 to enhanced usual care (EUC). The GEM intervention included 1 in-person and up to 12 telephone-delivered coaching sessions. Coaches supported goal setting and engagement with weight management programs, facilitated by a software tool. Patients in the EUC arm received educational handouts. We enrolled patients who spoke English or Spanish, were aged 18 to 69 years, and either were overweight (body mass index 25-29 kg/m2) with a weight-related comorbidity or had obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). The primary outcome (weight change at 12 months) and exploratory outcomes (eg, program attendance, diet, physical activity) were analyzed according to intention to treat. RESULTS We enrolled 489 patients (220 in the GEM arm, 269 in the EUC arm). Their mean (SD) age was 49.8 (12.1) years; 44% were male, 41% Hispanic, and 44% non-Hispanic Black. At 12 months, the mean adjusted weight change (standard error) was −1.4 (0.8) kg in the GEM arm vs −0.8 (1.6) kg in the EUC arm, a nonsignificant difference (P = .48). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed that the GEM arm had a greater change than the EUC arm in mean number of weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity other than walking, a finding that may warrant further exploration. CONCLUSIONS The GEM intervention did not achieve clinically important weight loss in primary care. Although this was a negative study possibly affected by health system resource limitations and disruptions, its findings can guide the development of similar interventions. Future studies could explore the efficacy of higher-intensity interventions and interventions that include medication and bariatric surgery options, in addition to lifestyle modification.",

New approaches to the study of the phenomenon are introduced, while a limited study puts some of the author’s suggestions to the test. The study addresses the modus operandi of political and labour surveillance focusing on late medieval English towns. Surveillance was intensified after the Black Death. Institutional and noninstitutional surveillance were part of everyday life, but they were also used by the ruling elites to consolidate their power. Surveillance was endured by the lower social ranks. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that sometimes popular classes resisted surveillance or even used it to their own advantage.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy is a universal experience shaped by sociocultural contexts. News media presents a unique opportunity to analyze public narratives of pregnancy and how it differs across cultures. Our study aims to (1) identify the most prevalent overall themes in news media narratives of pregnancy across 19 English-speaking countries, and (2) compare pregnancy narratives across geographic regions. We used the largest English news media corpus that included over 30 million news articles from more than 7000 news websites across 19 countries, and extracted a one-year data subset (2019; 1.5 billion words). Of the primary search terms ‘pregnant’ and ‘pregnancy’, we collated 240,464 descriptors that met criteria of lexical proximity and semantic bonding. Thereafter, we used topic modelling to identify the five most prevalent pregnancy-related themes: (1) complications and risk, (2) crime, (3) celebration, (4) celebrity births, and (5) contraception. Although there were regional differences, themes of complications and risk were most common, comprising 39.6% of all pregnancy narratives in our big-data corpus. The second-most dominant theme was crime (20.8%). Narratives of contraception were more prevalent in Europe, North America, and Oceania (27.2–31.3%) compared to Africa and Asia (11.9–19.6%). Though the vast majority of pregnancies are healthy, themes of complications and risk dominated the news media discourse; unchecked, this may be an avenue for misinformation, stress, and anxiety. In addition, lower prevalence of contraception narratives in Africa and Asia may reflect a gap that requires the attention of policymakers in building culturally-adapted programs to promote family planning and encourage open discussions about sexual health. Results contribute to the academic repository of societal representations of pregnancy through a big-data lens, providing contextual information for future development, implementation and evaluation of localized pregnancy-related campaigns.",

        "abstract": "\n \n The International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine—ISPRM—is the pre-eminent scientific and educational society for medical specialists in rehabilitation. Its mission is to optimize functioning and health-related quality of life and minimize disability in persons with medical problems. The World Congress remains the society’s face-to-face meeting to update topics related to disability and rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the academic proposals and abstracts submitted and accepted after peer review, sorting them out according to the Standardized Abstract Topic List of the ISPRM World Congress bidding guidelines. It also aims to give recommendations for future congresses.\n \n \n \n This study is a cross-sectional descriptive study of academic proposals and abstracts submitted to the ISPRM2023 Congress in Cartagena. To structure the academic program, the Congress Scientific Committee (CSC) opened 2 calls for wide-open international participation: one for academic proposals (Scientific sessions and workshops led by top experts) and another for abstract submissions inviting rehabilitation professionals in general, according to the ISPRM Congress classification of topics. Six members of the CSC assessed the academic proposals to ensure the representation of diverse topics and geographic areas. The abstracts were peer-reviewed following predefined quality criteria and assigned to 3 international juries according to their expertise.\n \n \n \n Participants submitted 142 proposals in English and 42 in Spanish from 6 continents: North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The Clinical Sciences category (58.7%) out of 138 accepted proposals was the most common. Of 703 submitted abstracts, 692 got accepted to present their work, but only 418 were presented on-site: 127 (30.4%) oral and 291 poster presentations. The distribution of the submitted abstracts showed substantial interest in clinical science and therapeutics (73.9%), followed by engineering and technology (9.1%), biomedical sciences (4.5%), and health policy and systems (4.5%).\n \n \n \n We made 8 recommendations for future congresses. It will be essential to review the topics involving emerging ones in physical and rehabilitation medicine that are gaining relevance, such as infectious diseases (COVID-19), cardiopulmonary disorders, metabolic diseases (obesity, osteoporosis), diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound, and electrodiagnosis.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Toxoplasma gondii, a ubiquitous zoonotic parasite infecting warm-blooded animals, poses a significant health threat to workers with occupational animal exposure (WOEA) due to their frequent contact with potential reservoirs. Existing data on T. gondii seroprevalence in the WOEA exhibits substantial global variation. This systematic review and meta-analysis, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, aimed to quantify the global seroprevalence of T. gondii infection among WOEA over the past five decades (1972–2023). We identified 66 eligible studies through a comprehensive search strategy encompassing English publications, with a total sample size of 15,279. A random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey transformation in STATA v16.0 accounted for the high heterogeneity observed. We estimated the pooled global seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in WOEA at 41% (95% CI: 36–47%). Subgroup analyses revealed significant variations by gender: males (63%) vs. females (37%) (p < 0.05), occupation: non-livestock workers (54%), livestock workers (47%), slaughterhouse workers (44%), and veterinary personnel (27%) (p < 0.05). Geographic trends showed the highest prevalence in Africa (51%), followed by South America (49%), Europe (47%), Australia (43%), Asia (36%), and North America (23%; p < 0.05). Lower prevalence was observed in high-income (39%) and upper-middle-income (38%) countries compared to lower-middle-income (44%) and low-income (48%) countries (p < 0.05). This analysis underscores the high global seroprevalence of T. gondii in the WOEA, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in this high-risk population.",

        "title": "What – and how – should we teach when we teach English in (South) Africa?",
        "abstract": "This study proposes changes to the teaching of English (language and literature) in South African institutions of learning in ways that prioritise functionality and communicative competence rather than the current dominant and problematic approach that seeks adherence to received standards. The author draws on his personal experience as a lecturer in a comprehensive South African university in a semi-rural setting as well as on postcolonial and decolonial perspectives on the many problems associated with epistemological access and literacy rates across South African schools and universities. Invoking a decades-old proposition by American writer, James Baldwin (1965) and Nigerian novelist, Chinua Achebe (1965) that formerly colonised people should use English for their practical purposes rather than try to imitate so-called native speakers, the author argues for a ‘world englishes’ and descriptive grammar approach to the teaching and learning of English in South Africa. Based on these ideas, a strategy with an action research component for the transformation of language, literature and literary pedagogy is proposed. Finally, the study demonstrated how such a strategy could also contribute to the objective of decolonising English studies in non-nativist ways. Though the discussion is grounded more particularly in South Africa, the issues and proposals are practicable to a significantly wider African context.\n\nKeywords: South Africa, English Studies, World Englishes, Prescriptive Grammar, Decolonisation",

        "abstract": "This study examines the Mediterranean Gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus), utilizing GPS/GSM transmitters year-round for the first time on this species. The research covers habitat use, migration patterns, and breeding behaviors, tracking 19 birds captured at breeding colonies in Poland. To capture the birds and fit transmitters, we selected representative locations: islands in dam reservoirs, gravel pits, rivers, and lakes. Mediterranean Gulls nested mainly in colonies of Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). By tracking birds with transmitters, we identified nine additional breeding sites within Poland, the Czechia, and Germany. We determined the mean length of phenological periods: breeding (76, April 10–June 26), autumn migration (11, June 26–July 7), winter (261, July 5–March 23), and spring migration (18, March 23–April 10). According to residence sites analysis, cropland was the most frequently used habitat during breeding (52.9%), while the open sea was predominant in winter (25.8%). We identified key wintering areas: the English Channel, the Utrecht–Antwerpen area, the North Sea coast, and the Irish Sea coast. One individual wintered along the coast of Portugal and near Malaga in Spain. An interesting discovery was the longer spring migration than autumn what involved visits to multiple potential breeding sites, leading to the mapping of a network of potential breeding areas. This underscores the need for proactive habitat protection and comprehensive conservation strategies. Given the Mediterranean Gull’s migratory behavior and lifecycle, the study advocates for it as a model for conserving migratory waterbirds.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology.",

        "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest public research funder in the world. In an effort to make publicly funded data more accessible, the NIH established a new Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy effective January 2023. Though the new policy was available for public comment, the patient perspective and the potential unintended consequences of the policy on patients’ willingness to participate in research have been underexplored. This study aimed to determine: (1) participant preferences about the types of data they are willing to share with external entities, and (2) participant perspectives regarding the updated 2023 NIH DMS policy. A cross-sectional, nationally representative online survey was conducted among 610 English-speaking US adults in March 2023 using Prolific. Overall, 50% of the sample identified as women, 13% as Black or African American, and 7% as Hispanic or Latino, with a mean age of 46 years. The majority of respondents (65%) agreed with the NIH policy, but racial differences were noted with a higher percentage (28%) of Black participants indicating a decrease in willingness to participate in research studies with the updated policy in place. Participants were more willing to share research data with healthcare providers, yet their preferences for data sharing varied depending on the type of data to be shared and the recipients. Participants were less willing to share sexual health and fertility data with health technology companies (41%) and public repositories (37%) compared to their healthcare providers (75%). The findings highlight the importance of adopting a transparent approach to data sharing that balances protecting patient autonomy with more open data sharing.",

        "abstract": "Vietnamese women have a higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and are less likely to have ever been screened for cervical cancer than their White counterparts in the US. This review synthesizes findings from published interventions to promote cervical cancer screening in this vulnerable population. Articles were identified through a systematic search of PsycInfo, Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials in October 2022. Articles were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English, included one or more interventions promoting cervical cancer screening, assessed at least one outcome relevant to screening, and included a sample of ≥ 70% Vietnamese participants. Quality assessment scores were computed using the Downs and Black Checklist. Fifteen articles met review inclusion criteria. Studies were, on average, of good quality. Most studies were conducted in the US (n = 12), used a quasi-experimental design (n = 9), and employed multiple intervention strategies (n = 12). Intervention strategies included educational sessions, lay health worker (LHW) outreach, small media, mass media, patient navigation, and community or healthcare-based strategies. The most common study outcomes were screening intention and receipt. All but two studies reported improved cervical cancer screening outcomes following intervention. Findings support the effectiveness of multicomponent culturally tailored interventions to improve cervical cancer screening outcomes in immigrant Vietnamese women. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions will be as successful in non-US countries and to address broader community- and healthcare-based factors in screening.",

        "abstract": "Background CA-125 testing is a recommended first line investigation for women presenting with possible symptoms of ovarian cancer in English primary care, to help determine whether further investigation for ovarian cancer is needed. It is currently not known how well the CA-125 test performs in ovarian cancer detection for patients from different ethnic groups. Methods A retrospective cohort study utilising English primary care data linked to the national cancer registry was undertaken. Women aged ≥ 40 years with a CA-125 test between 2010 and 2017 were included. Logistic regression predicted one-year ovarian cancer incidence by ethnicity, adjusting for age, deprivation status, and comorbidity score. The estimated incidence of ovarian cancer by CA-125 level was modelled for each ethnic group using restricted cubic splines. Results The diagnostic performance of CA-125 differed for women from different ethnicities. In an unadjusted analysis, predicted CA-125 levels for Asian and Black women were higher than White women at corresponding probabilities of ovarian cancer. The higher PPVs for White women compared to Asian or Black women were eliminated by inclusion of covariates. Conclusion The introduction of ethnicity-specific thresholds may increase the specificity and PPVs of CA-125 in ovarian cancer detection at the expense of sensitivity, particularly for Asian and Black women. As such, we cannot recommend the use of ethnicity-specific thresholds for CA-125.

        "abstract": "This study investigated the climatic risks and vulnerabilities of informal settlements in the Global South, as well as the extent to which these risks impact the vulnerabilities. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 methodology and deductive content analysis, this study critically examined 69 documents, including 28 scholarly journal articles obtained from Scopus and ScienceDirect and 41 web-based releases identified through the Google search engine and snowballing technique. Document inclusion criteria focused on the relevance to climate risks and vulnerabilities, excluding non-peer-reviewed, non-English, and unreliable sources, as well as irrelevant studies. Seven major climate risks impacting informal settlements were identified: floods (44), temperature changes (41), storms (31), sea level rise (30), drought (28), rainfall (23), and landslides (14). The primary vulnerabilities highlighted were poor housing conditions (64), health risks (50), lack of basic services (49), inadequate sanitation (41), inadequate hygiene (39), and limited access to water (38). The combination of vulnerabilities and climate risks creates considerable direct, indirect, and low-level threats to informal settlements. Despite Asia, Africa, and Latin America’s vulnerability, most studies focused on formal and developed areas. The findings highlight the critical need for climate adaptation strategies in informal settlements of the Global South to ensure the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are met.",

        "abstract": "Language, as an essential means of communication, is a constantly evolving system of sign units. It develops in accordance with established rules and laws, reflecting the living dynamics of society. Reflecting the character of the people, their thinking, culture, each language forms its own mechanism for expressing quantity. Addressing the problems of studying the number structure within a separate social and communicative system in close connection with the surrounding reality is relevant today. The purpose of this work is to study the specifics of the use of numer als in the vocabulary of the African American population of the United States. The research material was substandard lexical units with the numeral name component, obtained from English-language text sources: explanatory dictionaries of the American version of English, general American and African American slang, texts of musical compositions, Internet resources. The works of E. I. Putyatina, Yu. V. Bopp on the consideration of numerals, J. Dillard, J. Smitherman on the study of the African American Social and Ethnic Dialect formed the theoretical and methodological basis of this work. The methods of empirical observation and continuous sampling, statistical and contextual analysis are used in the work to identify functional, historical, socio-cultural aspects of the use of numerals in the colloquial speech of African Americans. The analysis of the expression of the potential of numerals shows the prominence of the manifestation of informational, influencing and conspiratorial functions. The results suggest that, thanks to metaphorical transference, numerals can be used to express evaluative values, expanding their function in the language.",

Background Emerging research on Long COVID has identified three distinct characteristics, including multi-organ damage, persistent symptoms, and post-hospitalization complications. Given Black and Latinx communities experienced significantly higher COVID rates in the first phase of the pandemic they may be disproportionately impacted by Long COVID. Methods Eleven focus groups were conducted in four languages with diverse Black and Latinx individuals (n = 99) experiencing prolonged symptoms of COVID-19 or caring for family members with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. Data was analyzed thematically. Results Most participants in non-English language groups reported they were unfamiliar with the diagnosis of long COVID, despite experiencing symptoms. Long COVID impacts spanned financial and housing stability to physical and mental health impacts. Participants reported challenging encounters with health care providers, a lack of support managing symptoms and difficulty performing activities of daily living including work.

        "abstract": "This study redirects attention from English-speaking African diaspora stand-up productions to French and German language expressions of purposively selected comedians with recent immigration history from Africa performing within mainland Europe. Through a socio-historical interrogation of specific colonial histories and joke themes, the paper comparatively explores the French language stage acts of Fary Lopez, Samia Orosemane (France) and Cécile Djunga (Belgium and France) and the German language works of Dave Davis (Germany), Charles Nguela (Switzerland), and Soso Mugiraneza (Austria). The aim is to show how the individuated colonial histories of the nations in which these comics reside and the chronicles of their relations with Africa(ns) and Black peoples feature in joke formulations and satiric jibes of the jokesters. Through these explorations, this essay studies how stand-up comedy’s transformative power challenges societal norms and attitudes using the backdrop of the concurrently heterogeneous and dissimilar colonial histories of the African continent and its diasporas. Moreover, through its focus on non-English expressions, it presents the unique intersections of language, “race,” ethnicity and colonial histories, as well as the geographic and linguistic spread of the African diaspora beyond European nations with direct colonial contact with the continent. Thus, the enquiry posits joke performances as platforms for cultural expression and critique as well as a site within which African peoples negotiate their presence in non-African environments.",

        "abstract": "The debates over the decolonisation of higher education in South Africa have resulted in differing perspectives on epistemologies and pedagogical techniques. While discussions rage about the conceptualisation and methods of decolonising higher education, as well as the practical efficiency of applying nuanced epistemologies, students continue to face racism, discrimination, and exclusion in higher education institutions. In its broadest sense, the foundation for the conversation on inclusion is founded on the elephant in the room, apartheid, which has been an Achilles heel in the change of South Africa's educational landscape. The apartheid curriculum, in all of its stages, largely prepared workers for low-wage, exploitative work. It showed little concern for emphasising Afrocentric foundations that expanded Black communities' cultural and traditional value systems. Bantu education's harsh social engineering prowess attempted to sidestep African philosophical frameworks (Ubuntu), which are crucial for motivating pupils' confidence, consciousness, and self-actualization. Against this backdrop, this study views decolonisation as a chance to include African languages, value systems, histories, customs, beliefs, cultures, and experiences in higher education.  This paper argues that the abstract inclusion of African languages devoid of intrinsic depth and essence is a patronising exercise purposed to vaguely position African languages alongside English and Afrikaans; doing so prohibits a deeper humanistic appreciation and knowledge of African traditions and indigenous systems. This paper emphasizes the crucial role of African languages and indigenous knowledge systems in addressing racism and inequality, and encourages their gradual and benign incorporation into higher education curricula.",

        "abstract": "Climate change poses unique challenges to maternal well-being and increases complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15–45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate-responsive policies.",

        "abstract": "Background Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) is a risk factor for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Understanding the changes in the electromyographic activity of the lower extremity muscles in individuals with DKV helps trainers design ACL injury prevention exercises. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the muscle activation of the lower limb muscles in individuals with DKV during single-leg and overhead squats. Methods Articles with titles, abstracts, and full texts were searched and screened independently by two reviewers in the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, without restrictions on publication date and in English using specified keywords from their inception to January 5, 2024. The quality of articles was evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black quality checklist. This meta-analysis used mean difference (MD) to compare the muscle activity patterns between individual with DKV and healthy individuals. Heterogeneity was detected using I-square (I2) test. Results In total, four papers with 130 participants were included in the study. Evidence showed a significant difference between the DKV group and the healthy group regarding the activities of the adductor magnus (MD: 6.25, P < 0.001), vastus medialis (MD: 13.23, P = 0.002), vastus lateralis (MD: 11.71, P = 0.004), biceps femoris (MD: 3.06, P = 0.003), and tibialis anterior muscles (MD: 8.21, P = 0.02). Additionally, muscle activity in the DKV group was higher than that in the healthy group. Conclusions This meta-analysis reveals distinct muscle activation patterns in individuals with dynamic knee valgus (DKV), with increased activity in key muscles suggesting compensatory responses. These findings underscore the need for targeted rehabilitation to address muscle imbalances and improve knee stability.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the study of language has evolved to explore the intricate nuances that shape our communication. One fascinating aspect of language is the use of idioms, which enable speakers to convey emotions indirectly through metaphorical expression. Although idioms enrich language and enhance its expressiveness and vividness, they often cause difficulties for people learning English. Among the myriad of idioms, those related to colours stand out as vibrant and captivating elements of linguistic diversity. Colour is an objective quality of the material world, encoded by language signs into a diverse array of information. Colour schemes and their designations are universal elements of the larger colour symbolic system, composed of multiple subsystems each with their own function and structure. As carriers of information about the surrounding world, colour designations are meaningful topics for cognitive, psycholinguistic, linguistic, and cultural studies. Understanding the structural and semantic features of colour idioms is essential for unravelling the intricate threads that make up effective communication, especially in the context of business discourse. The purpose of this paper is to delve into the semantic and structural features of colour idioms used in English business discourse. General methods (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, classification), theoretical methods (system analysis), graphical, as well as methods of logical, system-structural analysis and connections, comparative and dialectical approaches have been used. Results. Colour symbolism, like any other, is based on the peculiarities of the human psyche, on various associations, which are based on everyday human experience, fed by mythological, religious and aesthetic views. Examining business idioms with the colour component we can say that the semantics of this component often differ from the semantics of the same colour name in free use. The meanings of different colours in business idioms were scrutinized. A detailed analysis was also carried out and a certain proportion of idioms was determined by structures and colours, and the corresponding diagrams were given. The study shows the prevalence of the blue colour (17%), followed by black (15%), red and white (13% each). The yellow colour appears to be less utilized, constituting only 2% of the analysed idioms. The analysis of the syntactic characteristics of colour idioms has shown the dominance of nominal idioms (80%), followed by verbal idioms (10%) with adjectival making up 6% and the adverbial being represented by 1 lexical unit (4%). The originality of this article lies in the study of the symbolism of colours in terms of their use in business phraseological units, and a detailed structural and semantic analysis of colour idioms used in business discourse. Conclusion. The study underscores the significance of colour idioms within the business vocabulary, emphasizing their relevance. Proficiency in these expressions not only enriches one's linguistic repertoire but also enhances communication skills. Business idioms are an important segment in the business vocabulary. Colour idioms occupy a large share in business phraseology, the study of which requires further research.",

        "abstract": "Background Cancer immunotherapy has made significant progress in recent years, with numerous studies worldwide. Immunotherapy has had a transformative impact on oncology and autoimmune diseases. In the biomedical arena, hydrogels with good properties are widely used in cancer immunotherapy. Our study used bibliometrics to analyze the changing trends in using hydrogels for cancer immunotherapy. Methods From 2013 to 2023, a systematic search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify reviews and articles discussing the applications of hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy. The software CiteSpace was used to visually perform the bibliometric analysis in terms of research trends, countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords. Individual authors’ productivity was assessed with the Lotka’s law. The most relevant publication sources were identified by Bradford’s law. Results A total of 422 English-language publications related to hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy were collected. The number of annual publications increased rapidly after 2021 and remained constant for the past two years. China published the most articles in this field. The institution with the maximum number of published articles was the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China. Chen. Q was the most prolific author, and Liu. Z was the second most published author. In terms of journal contributions, the journal “Biomaterials” had the highest number of publications (n = 30). Biomaterials, Advanced Functional Materials and Journal of Controlled Release were the most influential journals. Keyword analysis revealed that cancer immunotherapy, drug delivery, immunogenic cell death, tumor microenvironment, injectable hydrogels, and immune checkpoint blockade were the primary research hotspots. In recent 3 years, adoptive T-cell therapy, black phosphorus, cell capture, adaptive cell therapy, tumor microenvironment, photodynamic therapy, and sustained release were the research hotspots in this field. Our study summarizes the objective of hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, providing a reference for potential researchers in related field. Conclusion This bibliometric analysis shows the progress and trend of research on hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy. This study provides a significant avenue for future investigation into current concerns and trends in research within this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective Investigate the association between demographic characteristics and emergency department (ED) epistaxis management and outcomes. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting TriNetX US collaborative database. Methods Adults presenting to the ED for epistaxis were retrospectively followed for 7 days. Spanish‐speaking patients were propensity score matched to English‐speaking patients by demographics and medical history. Outcomes included use of nasal decongestant, nasal packing or cautery, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, endoscopic control of hemorrhage, hospital admission, and mortality. The analysis was also performed with stratification by race and ethnicity. Results Spanish‐speaking patients were less likely to receive nasal packing or cautery [odds ratio, OR: 0.78; 95% confidence interval, CI: (0.68; 0.90)] or diagnostic nasal endoscopy [OR: 0.72; 95% CI: (0.52; 0.98)] compared to English‐speaking patients. Black patients were more likely to receive treatment with a nasal decongestant spray [OR: 1.31; 95% CI: (1.27, 1.36)], but less likely to receive any other treatment compared to White patients. Asian patients were less likely to undergo nasal packing or cautery [OR: 0.90; 95% CI: (0.82; 0.99)], but had more ED visits [(1.37; 1.32) P < .01] compared to White patients. Hispanic patients were less likely to be admitted [OR: 0.93; 95% CI: (0.87; 0.98)], and averaged fewer ED visits [(1.27; 1.30) P = <.0001] compared to non‐Hispanic patients. Conclusion While demographic trends in ED epistaxis management are nuanced, our results suggest that Spanish‐speaking, Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients are less likely to receive diagnostic and epistaxis control procedures. Additional research is needed to determine the etiology of these differences.",

The present study addresses this research gap through an investigation of cross-institutional ELTE across the country with a focus on its contextual configuration and social inclusion. To this end, the study has undertaken a secondary analysis of the Brazilian federal government’s 2019 higher education census data. The findings show that future English language teachers’ academic socialization takes place primarily in online undergraduate courses with an embedded teaching qualification, offered by private higher education institutions. These online ELTE courses are mainly attended by White students even though the Brazilian population consists predominantly of Blacks. We argue that considerable work needs to be undertaken to change the current configuration of ELTE in Brazil and promote social inclusion. We urge teacher educators to engage in the analysis of census data to contribute to nationwide teacher education policymaking.",

        "abstract": "Background The impact on cardiovascular health is lost when a patient does not obtain a newly prescribed lipid-lowering medication, a situation termed “initial medication nonadherence” (IMN). This research summarizes the published evidence on the prevalence, associated factors, consequences, and solutions for IMN to prescribed lipid-lowering medication in the United States. Methods A systematic literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar, along with screening citations of systematic reviews, identified articles published from 2010 to 2021. Studies reporting results of IMN to lipid-lowering medications were included. Studies that evaluated non-adult or non-US populations, used weaker study designs (e.g., case series), or were not written in English were excluded. Results There were 19 articles/18 studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Estimates of the prevalence of IMN to newly prescribed lipid-lowering medications ranged from 10 to 18.2% of patients and 1.4–43.8% of prescriptions (n = 9 studies). Three studies reported prescriber and patient characteristics associated with IMN. Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index score and no ED visits or hospitalization were associated with IMN. Lipid lowering prescriptions from primary care providers were also associated with IMN. Four studies described patient-reported reasons for IMN, including preference for lifestyle modifications, lack of perceived need, and side effect concerns. Four intervention studies reported mixed results with automated calls, live calls, or letters. One study reported worse clinical outcomes in patients with IMN: higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and greater risk of emergency department visits. Conclusions Up to one-fifth of patients fail to obtain a newly prescribed lipid-lowering medication but there is limited information about the clinical consequences. Future research should assess outcomes and determine cost-effective approaches to address IMN to lipid-lowering therapy.",

The translation by Pratt and Jiang has the most annotations and is easiest for the typical English reader to read. With an emphasis on the original language, Sanders' translation demonstrates the translator's goal of translating Chinese culture while veering toward thick translation. Black's translation is particularly unique because the translator frequently adopts the author's tone to infuse the original language with cultural context. The distinct socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds of the translators and the intended audience are the primary causes of the four translations' wildly divergent styles.",

        "abstract": "In 1957 Abbott and Ballantine described a highly toxic activity from a dinoflagellate isolated from the English Channel in 1949 by Mary Park. From a culture maintained at Plymouth Laboratory since 1950, we have been able to isolate two toxic molecules (abbotoxin and 59-E-Chloro-abbotoxin), determine the planar structures by analysis of HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectra, and found them to be karlotoxin (KmTx) congeners. Both toxins kill larval zebrafish with symptoms identical to those described by Abbot and Ballantine for gobies (Gobius virescens). Using surface plasma resonance the sterol binding specificity of karlotoxins is shown to require desmethyl sterols. Our results with black lipid membranes indicate that karlotoxin forms large-conductance channels in the lipid membrane, which are characterized by large ionic conductance, poor ionic selectivity, and a complex gating behavior that exhibits strong voltage dependence and multiple gating patterns. In addition, we show that KmTx 2 pore formation is a highly targeted mechanism involving sterol-specificity. This is the first report of the functional properties of the membrane pores formed by karlotoxins and is consistent with the initial observations of Abbott and Ballantine from 1957.",

        "abstract": "Objectives The purpose of this study was to systematically summarise the empirical evidence on the prevalence of HIV among long-distance truck drivers (LDTDs) from all parts of the world. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Data sources We searched PubMed, ProQuest Central, PubMed Central, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Global Index Medicus to identify relevant information published from 1989 to 16 May 2023. Eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed publications of English language reporting on the prevalence of HIV among LDTDs were included. Non-empirical studies like literature reviews were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis Using a standardised data abstraction form, we extracted information on study characteristics and HIV prevalence levels. Crude prevalence estimates per 100 participants were computed and later transformed using logit transformation to have them follow a normal distribution. A meta-analysis of prevalences using the random effects model was performed. The I2 statistic was used to quantify the degree of heterogeneity across studies. A subgroup analysis using meta-regression was performed to investigate factors that could explain variability across studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute tools and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of the included studies. To assess the certainty of evidence, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used. Results Of the 1787 articles identified, 42 were included. Most of the included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (45.23%, n=19) and Asia and the Pacific (35.71%, n=15). The pooled prevalence of HIV was 3.86%, 95% CI (2.22% to 6.64%). The burden of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 14.34%, 95% CI (9.94% to 20.26%), followed by Asia and the Pacific at 2.12%, 95 CI (0.94% to 4.7%) and lastly Western, Central Europe and North America at 0.17%, 95% CI (0.03% to 0.82%). The overall heterogeneity score was (I2=98.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion The global burden of HIV among LDTDs is 3.86%, six times higher than that of the general population globally. Compared with other regions, the burden of HIV is highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 14.34%, where it is estimated to be 3% in the general population. Thus, LDTDs endure a disproportionately high burden of HIV compared with other populations. Consequently, more LDTD-centred HIV research and surveillance is needed at national and regional levels to institute tailored preventive policies and interventions.

        "abstract": "Introduction Inequities in COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake among historically marginalised racial and ethnic groups in the USA persist. Individuals with rheumatic conditions, especially those who are immunocompromised, are especially vulnerable to severe infection, with significant racialised inequities in infection outcomes and in vaccine uptake. Structural racism, historical injustices and misinformation engender racial and ethnic inequities in vaccine uptake. The Popular Opinion Lleader (POL) model, a community-based intervention that trains trusted community leaders to disseminate health information to their social network members (eg, friends, family and neighbours), has been shown to reduce stigma and improve care-seeking behaviours. Methods and analysis This is a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial led by a team of community and academic partners to compare the efficacy of training POLs with rheumatic or musculoskeletal conditions using a curriculum embedded with a racial justice vs a biomedical framework to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake and reduce vaccine hesitancy. This trial began recruitment in February 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, USA. Eligible POLs are English-speaking adults who identify as Black and/or of African descent, have a diagnosis of a rheumatic or musculoskeletal condition and have received >=1 COVID-19 vaccine after 31 August 2022. POLs will be randomised to a 6-module virtual educational training; the COVID-19 and vaccine-related content will be the same for both groups however the framing for arm 1 will be with a racial justice lens and for arm 2, a biomedical preventative care-focused lens. Following the training, POLs will disseminate the information they learned to 12–16 social network members who have not received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine, over 4 weeks. The trial’s primary outcome is social network member COVID-19 vaccine uptake, which will be compared between intervention arms. Ethics and dissemination This trial has ethical approval in the USA. This has been approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (IRB, 2023P000686), the Northwestern University IRB (STU00219053), the Boston University/Boston Medical Center IRB (H-43857) and the Boston Children’s Hospital IRB (P00045404).

        "abstract": "Purpose To elucidate the impact of demographics, including gender, race, ethnicity, and preferred language, on regional visual field (VF) loss and progression in glaucoma. Methods Multivariable linear mixed regressions were performed to determine the impact of race, ethnicity, and preferred language on regional VF loss with adjustment for age and gender. Regional VF loss was defined by pointwise total deviation values and VF loss patterns quantified by an unsupervised machine learning method termed archetypal analysis. All cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed both without and with adjustment for VF mean deviation, which represented overall VF loss severity. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Results All results mentioned had corrected P values less than 0.05. Asian and Black patients showed worse pointwise VF loss than White patients with superior hemifield more affected. Patients with a preferred language other than English demonstrated worse pointwise VF loss than patients with English as their preferred language. Longitudinal analyses revealed Black patients showed worse VF loss/year compared to White patients. Patients with a preferred language other than English demonstrated worse VF loss/year compared to patients preferring English. Conclusions Blacks and non-English speakers have more severe VF loss, with superior hemifield being more affected and faster VF worsening. Translational Relevance This study furthered our understanding of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in glaucoma outcomes. Understanding the VF loss burden in different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups may guide more effective glaucoma screening and community outreach efforts. This research could help reduce vision loss and improve quality of life in disproportionately affected populations by guiding public health efforts to promote glaucoma awareness and access to care.",

        "abstract": "Little is known about mismatches between the language of mathematics testing instruments and the rich linguistic repertoires that African American children develop at home and in the community, in part because research paradigms with African American English (AAE) dialect speakers face complex challenges in measurement, historical exclusion, and other social, economic, cultural, and linguistic confounds. The current study aims to provide a proof of concept and novel explanatory item response design that uses error analysis to investigate the relationship between AAE child language and children's mathematics assessment outcomes. Here, we illustrate 2nd and 3rd grade children's qualitative patterns of performance on arithmetic tasks in relation to their AAE dialect use and elaborate a unified framework for examining child and item level linguistic characteristics. Results suggest that children draw upon their emerging (bi)dialectal repertoire with arithmetic problems when selecting appropriate problem-solving strategies on language-formatted problems. The mismatch of assessment language formatting with children's repertoires may disadvantage AAE speakers' strategy selections and result in a language-based performance disadvantage unrelated to mathematical ability. Research designs that look beyond correct/incorrect scoring to examine qualitative patterns of performance in AAE speaking children can provide valuable and oft-overlooked evidence when considering equity in mathematics assessment formats.",

        "abstract": "Background: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is an underrecognized chronic inflammatory skin condition with significant clinical features and potential for malignant transformation. To date, there are no studies comparing the course of this disease in women of color to other racial groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide a scoping review examining racial demographic data in VLS treatment studies and specifically assessing for the inclusion of women of color. Methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a primary literature search was conducted using 4 databases: Ovid Medline(R), Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science from all years to December 2022. We included published studies with adult women diagnosed with VLS and containing a treatment arm using topical corticosteroids. Single case reports, literature reviews, systemic reviews, meta-analyses, and reports not available in English were excluded. Results: Overall, 1340 nonduplicate studies were assessed for eligibility criteria. In total, 65 publications were included. Only 6 included racial demographic data. Black women made up at most 3.8% of the sample population and Latinx women made up at most 5.7%. Limitations: Our review focused on a specific intervention (ie, the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of VLS), which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other interventions. No risk of bias assessment was done due to the scoping nature of the review. Conclusion: Women of color are underrepresented in studies of topical corticosteroid use in adult women with VLS. Intentional diversity in recruitment will enable the collection of data that is both more accurate and reflective of a broader spectrum of perspectives and life experiences.",

        "abstract": "Drawing on theories of aversive racism and colour-blindness, which stress the invisibility of contemporary racism, this article analyses online discussions on taking the knee (TTK) during EURO2020 men’s football tournament. While highly visible racist abuse directed at Black English players after losing the final to Italy (dominative racism) received most public attention and repudiation, based on 6,850 English language tweets published on Twitter/X, this article shows how subtle racism and colour-blindness were reinforced in discussions around TTK over the duration of the tournament (aversive racism). The article also shows how individuals online developed a variety of strategies (evidence, othering, critique, and activism) to challenge the main arguments against anti-racist activism in football (identified in four themes: BLM, Marxism, virtue signalling, and woke). The article makes an original contribution by examining the changing intensity of online conversations on TTK over the duration of the tournament. Our analysis identifies key moments in the tournament, political elites’ rhetoric, and trends of success and failure as relevant factors that shaped vernacular conversations online. The discussion ultimately argues that investigating the temporal patterns of public discussions on (anti)racism provides valuable insights to understand the contemporary complexity of racism in football and society more broadly.",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the nature of morphological processes of colour terms among the users of English in Nigeria and their syntactic usages using a multi-dimensional approach in data gathering. The data was drawn from one hundred subjects across ten ethnic groups, including Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba as well as fifteen textual materials written in English by Nigerian scholars. The paper adopts a cognitive linguistic multidimensional framework. The paper reveals that the colour systems and usages among Nigerians contrast with the system within the native speakers of the language. For instance \"fresh leave green\", \"pale blue\", \"blood red\", \"yolk yellow\", \"black black\", \"dark so and so\", \"charcoal\", \"flesh\", , \"dirty green\", \"dudu\" and so on are formed through several morphological processes such as coining, clipping, blending, borrowing, compounding, reduplication and affixation as well as usage in various syntactic operations as in nominals and adjectives: \"The shirt is dark so and so.\" and \"The yellows ran out of the scorching sun.\" which serves as adjective and nominal plural respectively. Hence the paper concludes that morphology and syntax of most colours in Nigerian context have been influenced by many indigenous languages in the country. Hence, the hierarchy of the basic colours violates the Berlin and Kay\"s evolutionary sequence and Kay and Maffi\"s Trajectory model of Colour terms within the circle of the native speakers of English.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence of HIV-related stigma among people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland Design: A cross-sectional multicenter study nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). Methods: We included adult PWH enrolled in the SHCS, attending follow-up between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Inability to speak English, French, German, or Italian was the only exclusion criterion. Participants were invited to complete a validated 12-item HIV-stigma questionnaire comprising four stigma subscales (negative self-image, personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and concerns regarding public attitudes), plus two healthcare-related stigma items. Questionnaire responses were graded using a four-point Likert-type scale, higher scores indicating higher stigma. “Non-applicable,” inferring HIV-status non-disclosure, was possible for personalized stigma; stigma scores from participants answering “non-applicable” to at least one item were analyzed separately. Factors associated with HIV-stigma were identified through multivariable linear models. Results: Of 9643 PWH with a SHCS visit, 5563 participated in the study: 26% were female, 13% Black, and 37% heterosexual; median age was 53 years (interquartile range 44–59); 2067 participants (37%) gave at least one “non-applicable” response. Disclosure concerns had the highest stigma scores and were reported by 4656/5563 (84%). HIV-stigma was reported across all demographic groups. However, being female, Black, and heterosexual were independently associated with higher scores. Higher education and longer follow-up duration were associated with lower scores. Healthcare-related stigma was reported in 37% of participants. Conclusion: HIV-stigma was prevalent across all demographic groups. The association with being female and Black suggests that HIV-stigma accentuates preexisting sex and race inequalities.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Poor prenatal health is of particular concern among minoritized individuals who may experience adverse social determinants of health contributing to the intergenerational transmission of health disparities. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between psychosocial resources, and mental and physical health among a prenatal sample, and to explore if these relationships vary by race. Methods English-speaking pregnant individuals living in the United States were recruited using Centiment (n=340). Participants completed a 121-item cross-sectional survey. We conducted a single- and multi-group structural equation model to test hypothesized relationships, and then investigated differences by pregnant White individuals versus Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Results Our final single-group model exhibited good model fit (χ2 (43) = 99.07, p<.01, CFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.04, and RMSEA = 0. 06 (0.05 – 0.08)). After controlling for demographic characteristics and social determinants of health, higher levels of mindfulness were statistically significantly related to lower anxiety and depression scores (both p<.01). Higher levels of social supports were statistically significantly related to lower anxiety scores. Scale measurement invariance was confirmed for the multi-group model and the structural model was statistically significantly different between pregnant White individuals and BIPOC in this sample (Δ χ2 (27) = 116.71, p <.01). Conclusions Identification of core components of psychosocial resource interventions, consideration of upstream structural determinants, mindfulness and valued-living (MVL)-based strategies, cultural adaptation, and an emphasis on resilience rather than psychopathology may result in improved prenatal health among pregnant individuals traditionally underrepresented in research.",

        "abstract": "Background Post-stroke upper limb (UL) motor improvement is associated with adaptive neuroplasticity and motor learning. Both intervention-related (including provision of intensive, variable, and task-specific practice) and individual-specific factors (including the presence of genetic polymorphisms) influence improvement. In individuals with stroke, most commonly, polymorphisms are found in Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Apolipoprotein (APOE) and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT). These involve a replacement of cystine by arginine (APOEε4) or valines by 1 or 2 methionines (BDNF:val66met, met66met; COMT:val158met; met158met). However, the implications of these polymorphisms on post-stroke UL motor improvement specifically have not yet been elucidated. Objective Examine the influence of genetic polymorphism on post-stroke UL motor improvement. Design Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in English language. The modified Downs and Black checklist helped assess study quality. We compared change in UL motor impairment and activity scores between individuals with and without the polymorphisms. Meta-analyses helped assess change in motor impairment (Fugl Meyer Assessment) scores based upon a minimum of 2 studies/time point. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified based upon the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System as follows: small (0.08-0.18), medium (0.19 -0.40) and large (≥0.41). Results We retrieved 10 (4 good and 6 fair quality) studies. Compared to those with BDNF val66met and met66met polymorphism, meta-analyses revealed lower motor impairment (large ES) in those without the polymorphism at intervention completion (0.5, 95% CI: 0.11-0.88) and at retention (0.58, 95% CI:0.06-1.11). The presence of CoMT val158met or met158met polymorphism had similar results, with lower impairment (large ES ≥1.5) and higher activity scores (large ES ranging from 0.5-0.76) in those without the polymorphism. Presence of APOEε4 form did not influence UL motor improvement. Conclusion Polymorphisms with the presence of 1 or 2 met alleles in BDNF and COMT negatively influence UL motor improvement.

        "abstract": "After the British occupation (1806) the population of Cape Town had grown slowly; by 1829 the mother-city had more than 18 000 inhabitants comprising influential English traders, Dutch-speaking persons, Free Blacks and slaves. The general hygiene of the town was bad while health services left much to be desired. Living conditions of Poor Whites and Free Blacks were most unsatisfactory and had been aggravated by poverty, poor housing, diseases, and even epidemics. Ordinance 50, promulgated in 1828, placed the indigenous peoples on an equal footing with their European counterparts and integration was also socially acceptable. Yet the society was still dependent on a system of slavery and racial differentiation was still appreciable. The inadequate harbour facilities also retarded trade and general progress. Streets were dusty and unlit and the open canals (\"grachts\") were in a filthy and insanitary state. A few tiny suburbs (e.g. Sea Point and Wynberg) existed at this stage; local government in Cape Town was exercised by a government appointed magistrate and officials. A Supreme Court was created and in 1829 ten advocates and eleven attorneys practised in Cape Town. In contrast to the relatively poor social conditions, inhabitants enjoyed the benefits of ample educational and religious facilities. The cultural life of Cape Town flourished and fair provision was made for entertainment and recreation. By 1829 Cape Town was indeed a town beginning to develop a new character, mainly as a result of the influence of British immigrants.",

        "title": "AI-Driven Watermarking Technique for Safeguarding Text Integrity in the Digital Age",
        "abstract": "The internet’s growth has led to a surge in text usage. Now, with public access to generative AI models like ChatGPT/Bard, identifying the source is vital. This is crucial due to concerns about copyright infringement and plagiarism. Moreover, it is essential to differentiate AI-generated text to curb misinformation from AI model hallucinations.In this paper, we explore text watermarking as a potential solution, focusing on plain ASCII text in English. We investigate techniques including physical watermarking (e.g., UniSpaCh by Por et al.), which modifies text to hide a binary message using Unicode Spaces, and logical watermarking (e.g., word context by Jalil et al.), which generates a watermark key via a defined process. While logical watermarking is difficult to break but undetectable without prior knowledge, physical watermarks are easily detected but also easy to break.This paper presents a unique physical watermarking technique based on word substitution to address these challenges. The core idea is that AI models consistently produce the same output for the same input. Initially, we replaced every i-th word (for example, every 5th word) with a “[MASK],” a placeholder token used in natural language processing models to indicate where a word has been removed and needs to be predicted. Then, we used a BERT model to predict the most probable token in place of “[MASK].” The resulting text constitutes the watermarked text. To verify, we reran the algorithm on the watermarked text and compared the input and output for similarity.The Python implementation of the algorithm in this paper employs models from the HuggingFace Transformer Library, namely “bert-base-uncased” and “distilroberta-base”. The “[MASK]” placeholder was generated by splitting the input string using the split() function and then replacing every 5th element in the list with “[MASK]”. This modified list served as the input text for the BERT model, where the output corresponding to each “[MASK]” was replaced accordingly. Finally, applying the join() function to the list produces the watermarked text.This technique tends to generate nearly invisible watermarked text, preserving its integrity or completely changing the meaning of the text based on how similar the text is to the training dataset of BERT. This was observed when the algorithm was run on the story of Red Riding Hood, where its meaning was altered. However, the nature of this watermark makes it extremely difficult to break due to the black-box nature of the AI model.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nProstate cancer (CaP) disproportionately affects 1-in-4 Black men and is a stigmatised disease within their communities. Yet, Black men are underrepresented in CaP research concerning stigma, which necessitates a scoping review to map available evidence on this topic to inform future research.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo map published literature on stigma related to CaP in Black men to understand their experiences and/or perceptions and identify directions for future research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA scoping review was conducted using the five-step framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published in English addressing stigma related to CaP from the perspectives of Black men and/or their families were included. We searched six databases including Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and Google Scholar, from inception to April 2023. Citation searches were also conducted. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. Data was synthesised using descriptive content analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four eligible studies conducted in the USA, UK, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Cameroon and Canada from 1995 to 2023 were included. A total of 1867 Black men with/without a CaP diagnosis and 145 adult partners were included. Review findings showed a complex intersection of self-stigma, public stigma and structural stigma impacted Black men's perceptions of their masculinity. While men's experiences/perceptions of stigma varied depending on their illness status, there were commonalities in their masculinity concerns (underpinned by stigma), which influenced their attitude towards digital rectal examination, post-treatment side effects and social interactions on CaP. These have implications for public health messaging on CaP within Black communities, as well as patient-provider interactions with the men.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis novel review highlights the need to pay attention to how CaP is presented to Black men and their communities using avenues and languages that are culturally acceptable and empower them to negotiate self-stigma, public stigma and structural stigma related to CaP. Directions for further research were also identified.",

        "title": "Global prevalence and correlates of mpox vaccine acceptance and uptake: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Vaccination has been recommended as one of the most potent ways of controlling the mpox (formerly, monkeypox) outbreak, particularly among high-risk groups. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of mpox vaccine acceptance and uptake globally. Methods We searched multiple databases for peer-reviewed studies published in English from May 2022 to 25th November 2023 that evaluated mpox vaccine acceptance and/or uptake. We fit a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled mpox vaccine acceptance and uptake rates, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) across population outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses among the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Africa [AFR], Region of the Americas [AMR], South-East Asia Region [SEAR], European Region [EUR], Eastern Mediterranean Region [EMR], and the Western Pacific Region [WPR]), as well as among select population subgroups. Results Of the 2531 studies screened, 61 studies, with a cumulative sample size of 263,857 participants from 87 countries were eligible for inclusion. The overall vaccine acceptance and uptake rates were 59.7% and 30.9% globally. Acceptance and uptake rates among the LGBTQI+ community were 73.6% vs 39.8% globally, 60.9% vs. 37.1% in AMR, 80.9% vs. 50.0% in EUR, and 75.2% vs. 33.5% in WPR. Among PLHIV, vaccine acceptance and uptake rates were 66.4% vs. 35.7% globally, 64.0% vs. 33.9% in AMR, 65.1% vs. 27.0% in EUR, and 69.5% vs. 46.6% in WPR. Among healthcare workers, vaccination intention was 51.0% globally. Conclusions Tailored interventions are needed to bolster confidence in the mpox vaccine, maximize vaccine uptake, and increase vaccine access to close the gaps between acceptance and uptake especially among key populations residing in regions with low rates of acceptance and uptake.",

        "abstract": "In this essay, I explore the complex intersection of language, identity, and education with a particular focus on the importance of fostering linguistic equity in higher education settings. It is imperative for higher education institutions to reevaluate language-related practices and foster linguistic diversity and equity. Drawing upon linguistic theories and real-world examples, I highlight how language is deeply intertwined with personal identity, culture, and heritage. Various English dialects, such as African American Vernacular English, Chicano English, and others, are highlighted as valid linguistic expressions rather than deviations from a supposed standard. The role of standard academic English (SAE) in academia is examined, with a critical examination of how it can unintentionally perpetuate linguistic prejudice and inequality. I highlight activities in one university and provide practical strategies and classroom approaches to promote linguistic equity by showcasing rubric adjustments and teaching techniques that accommodate diverse language backgrounds. Educators can create inclusive learning environments that empower students to communicate effectively and celebrate their linguistic diversity, ultimately breaking free from historically biased language standards.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Disparities in cervical cancer screening rates among marginalized groups is a driver of inequalities in cervical cancer. Self‐sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a newly emerging alternative to clinician‐performed testing to screen for cervical cancer, and has high potential to reduce screening barriers in under‐screened and marginalized groups. We study the acceptability in of HPV self‐sampling and informational materials among Black/African American, Hispanic/Spanish speaking, American Indian/Alaska Native and transgender/nonbinary populations. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with patients, ages 30–65, who were Black/African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and/or transgender/nonbinary individuals assigned female at birth. Telephone interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. Patients did not complete the test, rather were asked about the attractiveness, comprehensibility, and acceptability of the HPV self‐test, instructions, and messaging. Results Among 23 completed interviews (5 American Indian/Alaska Native, 7 Hispanic [2 bilingual, 5 Spanish‐speaking], 5 Black/African American, and 6 transgender/nonbinary), patients from all groups thought the test was straightforward and convenient, and they would complete the test at home or in clinic. The transgender/nonbinary patients preferred at‐home testing. American Indian and transgender/nonbinary patients liked that the test might avoid pain, discomfort, and invasiveness. All patients liked the letter and instructions. All groups had specific suggestions for making the materials more culturally acceptable. Conclusions The HPV self‐test and the instructions and materials for use were acceptable for a diverse group of patients. Tailored outreach and messaging should be considered to reduce screening disparities among groups that have been historically underserved by the medical system.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The association between fluoroquinolone intake and Achilles tendinopathy (AT) or Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is widely documented. However, it is not clear whether different molecules have the same effect on these complications. The purpose of this study was to document Achilles tendon complications for the most prescribed fluoroquinolones molecules. Methods A literature search was performed on Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to April 2023. Inclusion criteria: studies of any level of evidence, written in English, documenting the prevalence of AT/ATR after fluoroquinolone consumption and stratifying the results for each type of molecule. The Downs and Black’s ‘Checklist for Measuring Quality’ was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Results Twelve studies investigating 439,299 patients were included (59.7% women, 40.3% men, mean age: 53.0 ± 15.6 years). The expected risk of AT/ATR was 0.17% (95% CI: 0.15–0.19, standard error (s.e.): 0.24) for levofloxacin, 0.17% (95% CI: 0.16–0.19, s.e.: 0.20) for ciprofloxacin, 1.40% (95% CI: 0.88–2.03, s.e.: 2.51) for ofloxacin, and 0.31% (95% CI: 0.23–0.40, s.e.: 0.77) for the other molecules. The comparison between groups documented a significantly higher AT/ATR rate in the ofloxacin group (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed the same risk (P = n.s.). The included studies showed an overall good quality. Conclusion Ofloxacin demonstrated a significantly higher rate of AT/ATR complications in the adult population, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed a safer profile compared to all the other molecules. More data are needed to identify other patient and treatment-related factors influencing the risk of musculoskeletal complications.",

        "abstract": "Overly restrictive clinical trial eligibility criteria can reduce generalizability, slow enrollment, and disproportionately exclude historically underrepresented populations. The eligibility criteria for 196 Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) trials funded by the National Institute on Aging were analyzed to identify common criteria and their potential to disproportionately exclude participants by race/ethnicity. The trials were categorized by type (48 Phase I/II pharmacological, 7 Phase III/IV pharmacological, 128 non-pharmacological, 7 diagnostic, and 6 neuropsychiatric) and target population (51 AD/ADRD, 58 Mild Cognitive Impairment, 25 at-risk, and 62 cognitively normal). Eligibility criteria were coded into the following categories: Medical, Neurologic, Psychiatric, and Procedural. A literature search was conducted to describe the prevalence of disparities for eligibility criteria for African Americans/Black (AA/B), Hispanic/Latino (H/L), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI) populations. The trials had a median of 15 criteria. The most frequent criterion were age cutoffs (87% of trials), specified neurologic (65%), and psychiatric disorders (61%). Underrepresented groups could be disproportionately excluded by 16 eligibility categories; 42% of trials specified English-speakers only in their criteria. Most trials (82%) contain poorly operationalized criteria (i.e., criteria not well defined that can have multiple interpretations/means of implementation) and criteria that may reduce racial/ethnic enrollment diversity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe number of tuberculosis (TB)-related morbidities and mortalities is still high in the South-east Asian region. This study was performed to characterize and visualize the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) TB research in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized. A total of 4822 documents were included in the final analysis according to the predefined eligibility criteria. The data were exported to the R package and VOSviewer software for factorial analysis and network visualization, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe included documents were published in English between 2020 and 2024 in 1255 journals. These documents were authored by 17005 authors (3.53 authors/document). The authors collaboration index was noticed 3.61. In total, 74.16% documents were published as the article. The highest number of documents were published in 2022 (n = 1089). The documents published in 2020 received the highest number of mean total citations per article (n = 8.64). The most published journal was Cureus Journal of Medical Science (n = 228). The most prolific author was Gupta A (n = 115). The most active institution was the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (n = 587). The top most trending topics were Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB elimination, molecular docking, extrapulmonary TB, Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, and multidrug resistance. India was the most productive country and had the strongest research collaboration with the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), and South Africa. Pakistan was mainly collaborating with the USA, the UK, Saudi Arabia, and China. The India and Pakistan collaboration was observed only in 66 documents.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is a poor output of scientific publication on TB in most SAARC countries. However, it is recognized that India has produced the highest number of scientific publications.

        "abstract": "Few studies have investigated paternal characteristics in relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and results are inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to review studies examining associations between characteristics of Black fathers and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the United States. A systematic narrative synthesis was conducted of research studies examining paternal characteristics of Black fathers in association with adverse pregnancy outcomes: preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, spontaneous abortion, and maternal mortality. Seven databases (Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for original research articles from inception to February 2023. Articles were excluded if they (a) were in a language other than English, (b) did not describe original research, (c) included a geographic region outside of the United States, (d) did not include adverse maternal outcomes as a study outcome, (e) did not describe race of fathers in the study sample, and (f) did not describe a paternal characteristic of Black fathers. The search resulted in 210 articles. Six studies were included in the final review; five studies examined associations between paternal characteristics of Black fathers and preterm birth, finding significantly increased odds of preterm birth among births with Black fathers. Among births with non-Hispanic Black paternity, the odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were reduced or not significantly associated. Researchers should continue to explore paternal factors that influence pregnancy outcomes in racial/ethnic-specific models to identify optimal intervention strategies to improve disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The present review was aimed to describe the prevalence and the regional distribution of malocclusion among preschool children worldwide. Two independent reviewers performed a systematic literature search to identify English publications from January 2010 to May 2024 using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Embase. Search MeSH key words were “malocclusion”, “primary dentition” and “child, preschool”. The reporting quality was assessed by the modified Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. We identified 2599 publications and recruited 47 articles. Fourteen of the included studies were conducted in Asia, four in Europe, twenty-eight in South America and one in Africa. The prevalence of malocclusion ranged from 28.4% to 83.9%, and half of the reported prevalences were higher than 50%. The highest percentage was in Asia (61.81%), followed by Europe (61.50%), South America (52.69%) and Africa (32.50%). Statistically significant differences existed in deep overbite, anterior open bite, posterior crossbite, edge-to-edge incisor relationship and distal step between continents (p < 0.05). Europe showed the highest prevalence (33.08%) of deep overbite. Africa showed the highest prevalence (18.60%) of anterior open bite. Europe showed the highest prevalence (15.38%) of posterior crossbite. The most common malocclusion traits were increased overjet and deep overbite. To conclude, malocclusion remained prevalent in the primary dentition and varied between countries.",

        "title": "Beyond the Prescription Pad—Finding a Window of Opportunity to Prevent Antibiotic Diversion and Non-Prescription Use",
        "abstract": "Background: Non-prescription antibiotic use is defined as taking antibiotics without medical guidance, which includes using leftover antibiotics, obtaining antibiotics from friends or relatives, or purchasing antibiotics without a prescription. This study aimed to (1) determine the symptoms prompting individuals to use non-prescription antibiotics, identify their sources of acquisition, and document the types of antibiotics utilized, (2) identify any associated side effects, and (3) gain insights into antibiotic storage practices, including whether antibiotics were used beyond their expiration date. Methods: A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted from January 2020-June 2021 in waiting rooms of six safety-net primary care clinics and two private emergency departments in Houston, Texas. Participants were read survey questions in English or Spanish by a bilingual research coordinator, and their responses to five questions about antibiotic use were recorded. Descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Among the 564 patients surveyed, the median age was 51 (range 19-92). The majority identified as female (72%), Hispanic/Latinx (47%), Black/African American (33%), held a college education (44%), and received public health insurance, such as Medicaid or County Financial Assistance (56%). Of all patients surveyed, 44% (246) reported taking an antibiotic without a prescription and answered questions about associated symptoms. Of all symptoms/illnesses associated with non-prescription use, the most common were sore throat (18%), dental symptoms (16%), and cold/flu (13%). The most common sources for non-prescribed antibiotics were leftover antibiotics (50%), from friends or relatives (31%), and purchased abroad (13%), although 3% had purchased non-prescription antibiotics from a local store or market (Figure 1). The most common antibiotics used were amoxicillin (38%) and penicillin (7%). The reported side effects were stomach pain/upset (24%), nausea and vomiting (19%), allergic reaction (e.g., rash) (14%), and diarrhea (14%). Among 246 participants reporting antibiotic use, 63% reported that the antibiotic they took had been previously prescribed for the same symptom/illness, and 93% had acquired antibiotics in a container, of which 90% reported that the container had an expiration date. Conclusions: Our survey reveals that 63% of individuals who use non-prescription antibiotics were motivated by having received prescribed antibiotics for similar symptoms previously. Leftover antibiotics were the source for half of all non-prescription use. These observations suggest that outpatient antibiotic stewardship campaigns have a window of opportunity at the time of the initial prescription of antibiotics, to focus on providing the shortest course possible, and to deliver antibiotic safe use information at that time.

        "abstract": "Introduction The study examines the feasibility, quality of counseling, and knowledge after a virtual Group Contraception Counseling (GCC) session. Methods At an urban academic hospital, we recruited English-speaking pregnant women aged 15–49 who had access to a video-enabled electronic device. Participants engaged in a standardized 45-minute educational session about contraceptive methods in groups of two to five persons conducted over a video conferencing platform. The primary outcome was participant perceived quality of contraception counseling measured by the Person-Centered Contraception Counseling (PCCC) scale. The secondary outcomes were knowledge change before and after counseling, and postpartum contraception uptake. We used an adjusted multivariable linear regression model to analyze knowledge scores. Results Twenty-two participants completed the study. Participants identified primarily as Black or Hispanic/Latinx (78%), in a partnership (50%), having completed college (59%), and having an annual income of less than $50,000 (78%). A total of 77% of participants recorded a perfect score for quality of counseling using the Person-Centered Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) scale. There was an increase in knowledge after counseling (Mean difference (M)=0.07, p<0.01). Notably, certain subsets of participants had decrease in knowledge scores after counseling. Participants who used postpartum contraception were more likely to have increase in knowledge after counseling compared to those who did not (Mean difference (M)=0.09, p<0.01). Conclusion Our findings suggest virtual group contraception counseling is feasible for providing high-quality counseling and can possibly increase contraceptive knowledge.",

One of the efforts to reduce the waste issue is the empowerment of the Medan Krio community, especially PKK (Pemberdayaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga) members through the cultivation of Black Soldier Fly (BSF) maggots, which can break down organic waste naturally and have high economic value. This community service program aims to empower the Medan Krio community by increasing knowledge and skills in managing household waste through socialization and training in BSF maggot cultivation. The methods used were socialization, training, monitoring, and evaluation results in pretests and posttests, all done offline. The participants of this program were 40 PKK members in Medan Krio Village. The results show that knowledge about maggot morphology increased by 80%, maggot culture by 90%, and maggot utilization by 70%. In addition, there was an increase in maggot cultivation experience by 100% and the motivation to carry out maggot cultivation by 50%. The understanding of maggot cultivation increased by 90%. The communities now have a new routine that can improve the family economy from the maggot cultivation business and increase awareness of managing household waste wisely and having economic value.\nKeywords: community empowerment, waste management, maggot Black Soldier Fly cultivation, improvement of the family economy",

        "abstract": "Contexte et objectif: Les enfants nés avant le terme constituent une population à haut risque de retard de développement  neurologique. Les données concernant le neurodeveloppement des enfants nés prématurés dans les pays en voie de développement,  ainsi que les facteurs associés sont encore insuffisantes. La présente étude a évalué le neurodéveloppement des enfants nés prématurésà 6 mois d’âge corrigé. \nMéthodes:  Il s’agissait d’une étude de suivi prospectif à visée analytique qui s’est déroulée dans les hôpitaux sélectionnés de la ville de  Kinshasa de janvier à décembre 2022. Les prématurés ont été enrôlés à leur admission (M0) et ont bénéficié d’une évaluation du neurodéveloppement à 6 mois d’âge corrigé au moyen de l’échelle «ASQ3» \nRésultats: Au total 132 nouveau-nés prématurés ont été enrôlés dans les 3 sites. Le terme moyen était de 33 semaines, le sex ratio M/F était de 0,96; le poids variait entre 900 et 2350gr. Les  principales pathologies évoquées étaient l’infection néonatale (93,2 %), l’hypoglycémie (15,2 %) et l’hémorragie intracrânienne (7,6%).  Sur 132 prématurés recrutés, 11 étaient décédés en période néonatale (8,3%). Après la sortie des hôpitaux, 5 étaient décédés, 49 perdus  de vue et 2 refus de suivi. Seuls 65 enfants étaient évalués à 6 mois d’âge corrigé. Le score d’ASQ3 a révélé qu’à 6 mois d’âge corrigé, 73,8  % des nourrissons anciens prématurés avaient présenté un neurodéveloppement normal et 26,2% avaient un neurodéveloppement  anormal (zone grise et/ou noire). Les facteurs associés aux troubles du neurodéveloppement comprenaient: le terme < 32 semaines, la  naissance par césarienne, l’APGAR <7 à la 5ème minute de vie et l’hypoglycémie. \nConclusion: Le suivi du neurodéveloppement du prématuré reste difficile dans notre contexte de vie. La naissance avant 32 semaines par césarienne et l’hypoglycémie exposent l’enfant  en croissance à une perturbation du neurodéveloppement.  \n  \nEnglish title: Neurodevelopmental outcome at 6 months of corrected age of children born prematurely: an analytical prospective longitudinal follow-up study in Kinshasa \nContext and objective: Children born preterm are a population at high risk of neurodevelopmental delay. There is still a lack of  knowledge about the neurodevelopment of preterm infants in developing countries and the factors associated with preterm birth. The present study evaluated the neurodevelopment of children born preterm at 6 months corrected age. \nMethods: This was a prospective  analytic follow-up study that took place in selected hospitals from January to December 2022. Prematured newborns were enrolled upon admission and received an assessment of neurodevelopment at 6 months (M6) of corrected age using the \"ASQ3\"scale. \nResults: A total  of 132 preterm neonates were enrolled at 3 sites. Mean term was 33 weeks, M/F sex ratio was 0.96; mean weight ranged from  900-2350gr. Out of 132 preterm infants recruited, 11 died in the neonatal period (8.3%). After discharge from hospitals, 5 died, 49 were lost to follow-up and 2 were denied follow-up. Only 65 children were assessed at 6 months of corrected age. The ASQ3 score revealed that  at 6 months corrected age, 73.8 % former preterm infants showed normal neurodevelopment and 26.2% had abnormal  neurodevelopment (gray and/or black areas). \nConclusion: Monitoring neurodevelopment in premature infants remains difficult in our  context.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, maternal health inequities disproportionately affect Global Majority (e.g., Asian, Black, and Hispanic) populations. Despite a substantial body of research underscoring the influence of racism on these inequities, little research has examined how experiences of gendered racial microaggressions during pregnancy and birth impact racially and ethnically diverse Global Majority pregnant and birthing people in obstetric hospital settings. We evaluated the psychometric properties of an adapted version of Lewis & Neville’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale, using data collected from 417 Global Majority birthing people. Findings from our study indicate that our adapted GRMS is a valid tool for assessing the experiences of gendered racial microaggressions in hospital-based obstetric care settings among Global Majority pregnant and birthing people whose preferred languages are English or Spanish. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis demonstrated high construct validity of the adapted GRMS scale (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.1089 (95% CI 0.0921, 0.1263), Comparative Fit Index = 0.977, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.075, log-likelihood c2 = -85.6, df = 8). IRT analyses demonstrated that the unidimensional model was preferred to the bi-dimensional model as it was more interpretable, had lower AIC and BIC, and all items had large discrimination parameters onto a single factor (all discrimination parameters > 3.0). Given that we found similar response profiles among Black and Hispanic respondents, our Differential Item Functioning analyses support validity among Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-speaking birthing people. Inter-item correlations demonstrated adequate scale reliability, α = 0.97, and empirical reliability = 0.67. Pearsons correlations was used to assess the criterion validity of our adapted scale. Our scale’s total score was significantly and positively related to postpartum depression and anxiety. Researchers and practitioners should seek to address instances of gendered racial microaggressions in obstetric settings, as they are manifestations of systemic and interpersonal racism, and impact postpartum health.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nRacial differences in prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shifted in the United States (US) since the 1990s. This review addresses the nature and context of this shift and discusses potential contributing factors and areas for future research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventeen population-based epidemiological birth cohort studies on ASD prevalence in the US that included race as a variable are included in the review. Studies were identified via a keyword search on PubMed. To be included, studies were required to include race or ethnicity as a variable in the prevalence estimates, include at least 1000 cases with autism, and be published in English by June 3rd, 2023.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults suggest that in nearly all birth cohorts prior to 2010, ASD prevalence rates were highest among White children. ASD prevalence rates among Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) children (22.3, 22.5, and 22.2 per 1000, respectively) surpassed prevalence rates among White children (21.2 per 1000) in the 2010 birth cohort and continued to increase in the 2012 birth cohorts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are persistent racial differences in ASD prevalence in the US, and these differences were inverted after 2010, when ASD prevalence among Black, Hispanic, & API children surpassed ASD prevalence among White children. Possible drivers of this racial repatterning of ASD prevalence include changes in ASD screening and diagnosis, changes to health insurance policy, changes to immigration policy, and increased education attainment by minority groups.",

        "title": "Perceptions of Maternal Mortality in the Pregnant Missouri Birthing Population",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The US has the highest maternal mortality (MM) rate among developed countries with significant disparities between Black, Hispanic, and Native American birthing people and their White counterparts. Missouri ranks among the 10 states with the highest MM. It has been presumed that the general population’s lack of knowledge surrounding the issue and distrust of the medical system both contribute significantly to MM. Thus, suggestions for improving maternal mortality have been centered primarily around education. To date, there has been a paucity of research surrounding the knowledge and perceptions of MM in the general population. This study sought to understand the perceptions of MM among a representative sample of pregnant people in Missouri. Methods: This is an anonymous, cross-sectional survey conducted from May 2022-August 2022 across the state of Missouri. The Missouri Perinatal Quality Collaborative/ Maternal-Child Learning and Action Network (LAN/PQC) iteratively developed a 46-question survey, distributed in both English and Spanish, to elicit opinions of birthing people in Missouri, assessing their knowledge about state-specific maternal mortality issues. The target population included individuals 18 years and older with a Missouri zip code who identified as someone of birthing potential. Those without a Missouri zip code, who identified as male, and not pregnant were excluded. All survey questions were uploaded into a secure database (REDcap) and accessible to participants through a survey link. The survey was pilot tested by placing a QR code and survey link on social media platforms by the authors. Once feasibility was confirmed, an additional survey link was distributed through an email listserv purchased from a data distribution platform (Dynata). Demographic data, including age, race, pregnancy status, number of lifetime pregnancies, number of living children, and preferred language, were recorded. All survey responses were documented without patient identifiers following signed, informed consent. The survey was aimed to sample 1500 respondents online racially representative of the Missouri birthing population. The study was approved by Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City IRB and was designed to follow STROBE guidelines for the reporting of cross-sectional studies. Participants were asked general knowledge about maternal mortality including whether or not they knew it was a public health issue in Missouri, if they knew someone who died as a result of pregnancy, and if they themselves had ever been concerned about dying as a result of pregnancy. These results were reported as “yes” or “no” responses. Qualifying questions to positive responses included whether the perceived rate of maternal mortality in Missouri was high or low, suspected underlying medical and social causes and timeframe, and personal relationship to the decedent in the case of known death. For those who answered positively about concern for dying in pregnancy, qualifying responses were recorded on a Likert scale (1 for not at all concerned, 2 for a little concerned, 3 for somewhat concerned, 4 for very concerned and 5 for extremely concerned). Respondents were also asked to identify certain groups of people according to race, income status, insurance status, urban versus rural place of residence, educational status, and marital status that may suffer disproportionately from maternal deaths. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4. Descriptive statistics are reported in percentages and counts for categorical outcomes and means ± SD for continuous outcomes. Knowledge questions were analyzed as yes or no responses and reported in frequencies. Perceived etiologies for maternal mortality are reported as nominal data in percentages. Logistic regression was performed utilizing employment status, insurance status, marital status, education attainment, and difficulty with finances as predictors variables. Questions were stratified by age, race, and self-reported zip code. Results: Eighty-five people met inclusion criteria with an average age of 30.4 ± 7.6 and parity of 3.1 ± 2.0. Of those, 65.9% identified as White, 25.9% as Black, 8.2% as Hispanic, 3.5% as Native American, 4.7% as Asian, and 2.4% as Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander. Over 85% reported awareness that MM was an issue in Missouri, and 59.2% reported they believed those numbers to be high. Thirty percent of people reported knowing someone who had died from a pregnancy-related cause; of those, 73.9% reported that the person who died was a family member or personal friend. Only 21.2% of pregnant people reported not being concerned about dying during their pregnancy. Seventy-five percent of the pregnant cohort reported trusting their medical providers’ recommendations. Discussion: Our study found that over 85% of pregnant people in Missouri are aware of MM, and a majority are aware that the MM rate is high. This contradicts commonly held beliefs that our patients’ lack of knowledge may be an opportunity for our efforts. Our survey also revealed that 75% of patients trust their medical providers despite much blame being placed on distrust of the health care system. Further surveys of health care providers may be helpful to reveal how exactly MM can be improved.",

        "abstract": "Frequent use of pain relief medications among patients with migraine can result in disease worsening and medication-overuse headache (MOH), a painful and debilitating condition. We sought to conduct a cross-sectional survey among adult patients diagnosed with migraine to determine: 1) their awareness of MOH, and 2) their knowledge of the condition and its prevention, and 3) the association of these factors with actual use of pain relief medications. We recruited and interviewed 200 English-speaking adults with migraine who had a clinic visit with a neurologist or primary care provider within the past month. Patients were identified via an electronic health record query. Almost 40% of participants had never heard of the term ‘medication-overuse headache.’ In bivariate analyses, participants who were Black or Hispanic and those with limited health literacy were less likely to have heard of MOH. Participants scored an average of 2.1 (range: 0–3) on a MOH knowledge measure; older participants, those with limited health literacy, lower education, and little or no migraine-related disability demonstrated less knowledge. Almost a third (31.5%) of patients reported overusing pain relief medication and were at risk for MOH. Overuse was not significantly associated with MOH awareness, knowledge, or sociodemographic factors, but was related to greater migraine-related disability. Our findings suggest that patient awareness and knowledge of MOH is suboptimal, particularly among older adults, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with limited health literacy. Interventions are needed to prevent MOH and better inform patients about risks associated with frequent use of pain relief medications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Context The rise in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use has been characterized by widening disparities between the least and most socially marginalized. Given access barriers, there is limited CGM patient experience information that is inclusive of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus from socially marginalized backgrounds. Objective To understand the CGM usage experience in the primary care setting across a US Medicaid population with type 2 diabetes at federally qualified health centers. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured phone interviews with 28 English- or Spanish-speaking participants prescribed the CGM who were enrolled in a US Medicaid program that subsidized CGMs. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed and analyzed by reflective thematic analysis. Results Twenty-eight participants (75% female, median age 56 years with interquartile-range 48-60 years) were interviewed. Participants were from different racial/ethnic backgrounds: 21% non-Hispanic White, 57% Hispanic, and 18% non-Hispanic Black. Participants primarily spoke English (68%) or Spanish (32%), and 53% reported 9 or fewer years of formal education. We identified 6 major themes: initial expectations and overcoming initiation barriers, convenience and ease promote daily use, increased knowledge leads to improved self-management, collaboration with provider and clinical team, improved self-reported outcomes, and barriers and burdens are generally tolerated. Conclusion CGM use was experienced as easy to understand and viewed as a tool for diabetes self-efficacy. Expanded CGM access for socially marginalized patients with type 2 diabetes can enhance diabetes self-management to help mitigate diabetes outcome disparities.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we report a comprehensive analysis of the disparities in undergraduate degree achievements across different demographic groups in English universities. The focus is on the “degree achievement gap”, which refers to the variation in the rates of students from diverse backgrounds obtaining First- or Upper Second-Class degrees. The significance of this gap lies in its profound impact on graduates’ future opportunities, particularly in terms of access to advanced studies and professional trajectories. Recognising the critical nature of this issue, the Office for Students (OfS) has emphasised the need for higher education institutions to actively work towards bridging this gap to enhance equity and social mobility. To map how far the call for bridging this gap has been effective, our research examines trends and patterns by age, ethnicity, disability, and gender over a five-year period from 2017/2018 to 2021/2022. Methodologically, this paper employs a detailed descriptive analysis. Our findings highlight a persistent and significant gap for Black students, who are consistently less likely to achieve a First- or Upper Second-Class degree when compared to their White peers. Based on the analysis, literature review, and policy mapping exercise, we make recommendations for the implementation of targeted support, student engagement, revisiting curriculum designs, and the promotion of a more inclusive campus culture. The insights and proposed strategies will be of interest to educators and policymakers.",

As a result of the study, the role of lexical borrowings from the languages of Indian peoples and African immigrants in the formation of the lexical composition of the Spanish language of Latin America was revealed. The degree of influence of the American version of English on the vocabulary of Latin American national languages was determined. The main structural and semantic modifications that the vocabulary of the Spanish language endured under the influence of linguistic and cultural contacts were described. The main groups were identified culturally marked lexical units reflecting historical, socio-political, economic and cultural processes that took place in Latin American countries. Specific examples show the functioning of culturally marked vocabulary in modern Latin American speech. The study was conducted on the material of the Spanish language of Latin America.",

Our article offers a comparative analysis of the representation of black queer women by black queer and cisgender authors in selected isiXhosa and English poetry. The poems selected are from Unam Wena (2021) by Mthunzikazi Mbungwana and red cotton (2018) by vangile gantsho. Firstly, we explore how queer feminism is captured from a Xhosa perspective. Secondly, we explore how English is used to expose readers to black queerness, and, thirdly, we question how literary scholarship influences or limits black queer feminist literature and the functionality of queer feminist poetry as representations of black women. Discourse theory is used to examine how authors of the selected poetry construct knowledge about black queerness from a feminist perspective and shape how people understand it. In this article we adopt a narrative enquiry within the constructionism paradigm with qualitative textual analysis. Our analysis of the poetry reveals that, although the selected poets use two different languages, the same protest voice is foregrounded, with observable differences being primarily technical—namely how form, sound, and structure are employed to set the tone and mood in the issues addressed.",

        "abstract": "Background Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating disease that can affect the entire reproductive life course of women, with potential adverse effects on pregnancy. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and endometriosis. Method Relevant articles were searched from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from inception up to December 2023. The full-text observational studies published in English that had a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis were included. The case group included pregnant women diagnosed with endometriosis at any stage, while the control group consisted of pregnant women who had not been previously diagnosed with endometriosis. Two authors extracted and analyzed the data independently. Disagreements were reconciled by reviewing the full text by a third author. Endnote X9 was used for screening and data extraction. We used fixed and random effects models in Review Manager 5.3 to analyze the pooled data. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Results Out of the 9863 articles reviewed, 23 were selected for meta-analysis. According to the results of this study, there was an association between endometriosis and gestational hypertension (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16; I2 = 45%, P < 0.00001; N = 8), pre-eclampsia (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.36; I2 = 37%, P < 0.00001; N = 12), and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.21; I2 = 8%, P = 0.0001; N = 8). Conclusions This study confirmed that endometriosis may elevate the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorders. Raising awareness of this issue will help to identify effective strategies for screening and early diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Many musicologists and researchers of popular music have recently stressed the omnipresence of covers in today’s music industry. In the sociolinguistics of music, however, studio-recorded covers and their potential differences from ‘original’ compositions have certainly been acknowledged in passing, but very few sociolinguists concerned with the study of song seem to have systematically explored how language use may differ in such re-imagined musical outputs. This article reports on a study which examines the language use of 45 blues artists from three distinct time periods (viz., 1960s, 1980s, and 2010s) and three specific social groups (viz., African American; non-African American, US-based; and non-African American, non-US based) distributed over 270 studio-recorded original and cover performances. Through gradient boosting decision tree classification, it aims to analyze the artists’ use of eight phonological and lexico-grammatical features that are traditionally associated with African American English (viz., /aɪ/ monophthongization, post-consonantal word-final /t/ deletion, post-consonantal word-final /d/ deletion, alveolar nasal /n/ in  ultimas, post-vocalic word-final /r/ deletion, copula deletion, third-person singular  deletion, and not-contraction). Our analysis finds song type (i.e., the distinction between covers and originals) to have no meaningful impact on artists’ use of the examined features of African American English. Instead, our analysis reveals how performers seem to rely on these features to a great extent and do so markedly consistently, regardless of factors such as time period, socio-cultural background, or song type. This paper hence builds on our previous work on the language use of blues performers by further teasing out the complex indexical and iconic relationships between features of African American English, authenticity, and the blues genre in its various manifestations of time, place, and performance types.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the typologically unusual case of borrowed tense-mood-aspect morphemes. Data are taken from Louisiana Creole, a critically endangered French-lexifier creole. Over the course of its history, Louisiana Creole has been in contact with local varieties of both French and English, including African American English. It will be shown that points of structural congruity between Louisiana Creole and African American English have facilitated the borrowing of two aspect markers for speakers competent in both varieties. African American English stressed BIN has been borrowed and marks remote past habitual, stative, and completive. The adverb still has been borrowed and subsequently has grammaticalized as a continuative marker via spec-to-head reanalysis. These borrowings are integrated into the inflectional domain as functional heads marking aspect. Their ordering constraints are evaluated relative to a previous hierarchy proposed by Rottet. Discussion of contact-induced change in creole languages has typically been confined to examination of interactions with the lexifier, the language which contributes the majority of a creole’s vocabulary (in this case, French). Fewer studies have presented detailed accounts of how creoles behave when in contact with other languages, meaning that this particular contact context remains undertheorized.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we analyze how Malabo and Africa appear represented in the novel The Lower River, by American author Paul Theroux, and how his cultural and linguistic vision of- the city and the continent reach Spain through the translated version. In order to do so, a description of the publishing market is provided to understand its importance both for the original text and for the translation in Spain. Through a textual analysis of both texts using the software Wordsmith Tools (Scott 2004), including word-frequency and concordance searches, we will explore if there is a positive or negative portrayal of Malabo. Finally, through a linguistic comparative analysis of the original and the translation, we will determine to what extent the reader in Spain can draw the same inferences as the English reader of the original.",

        "abstract": "In this June 2024 issue of the Science Education International, we are proud to present an array of scholarly articles that highlight the diverse and innovative approaches to science education from ten different countries: Türkiye, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, USA, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and China. This collection underscores the global commitment to enhancing science education through varied methodologies, cultural contexts, and unique challenges. Some of these articles were presented at the 7th ICASE World Science and Technology Education Conference, held in Dubai between March 27 and 30, 2024, further enriching the discussions with insights shared among global experts. The first article is from Türkiye. The article mentions that the rise in STEM education has led to more authors promoting Arduino in STEM. While research exists on Arduino and STEM separately, more studies on their relationship are needed. This study uses software tools (Vosviewer, Biblioshiny) and bibliometric methods, analyzing documents from Scopus (2013-2022). Performance analysis showed publication and citation trends, highlighting top contributors. Bibliographic mapping revealed conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. Results indicated prolific authors and institutes in Türkiye, with the most cited from the USA. Türkiye may soon lead due to high growth rates and younger documents. The study warns of potential monopolization and highlights the need for increased researcher mobility and collaboration. Overall, Arduino shows great promise in future STEM activities. The second article is from Greece. The article surveys primary students in Greece on their views toward STEM education based on urban or rural settings and gender. The sample included 281 students from Attica and 69 from a Greek province. Data was collected via a close-ended digital questionnaire. Most students felt good at math and science but unlikely to pursue related careers. They reported strong communication and cooperation skills. Rural students showed more confidence in improving their math and science skills, the usefulness of STEM knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. Boys showed slightly more interest in STEM careers. The study suggests further research on geographical, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in STEM education. The third article, a case study from Estonia, aimed to enhance pre-service science teachers’ readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), ICT use, and real-life applications in teacher training. It explored their perceptions of these methods and how their views evolved over time. A questionnaire was administered to 50 pre-service science teachers before and after their 2-year training, with data analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings showed that teachers studying multiple science subjects valued integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples more, with significant perception changes over time. Nearly half did not see IBL as crucial, and only a quarter recognized the importance of ICT. The fourth article is from Latvia. The article addresses that teacher competence management and development are now school responsibilities, but school leaders often lack the tools and experience. Competence management in schools can involve identifying and implementing professional development (PD) tailored to teachers' needs. Unlike the \"one size fits all\" approach, personalized PD can be more effective. This study focuses on identifying science teacher profiles to improve teaching that promotes student conceptual understanding (CU). Using a mixed-method approach, the performance of 26 urban science teachers was observed and analyzed. The study identified six distinct teacher profiles, demonstrating varied PD needs and offering a methodology for using lesson observation data to create teacher profiles in small samples. The fifth article is the second article from Greece. The study examines 12th-grade students' understanding of \"orbital\" and \"electron cloud\" concepts in quantum contexts (n=1 and n=2) through verbal and pictorial representations. It involved 192 students from six urban schools in Northern Greece using a paper-and-pencil assessment. Results show students struggle more with verbal explanations than pictorial ones and exhibit inconsistencies between these representations. They understand the electron cloud better verbally, but the orbital better pictorially. Representations for n=2 are more challenging than for n=1. Students were categorized into four classes based on their profiles, with implications for science education discussed. The sixth article is written by researchers from the Philippines and the USA. This meta-analysis study (2017-2021) assessed the impact of Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approaches on learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Analyzing various SSI techniques, the findings revealed a strong positive influence on understanding complex environmental issues and promoting sustainable behavior. The study noted that SSI fosters critical thinking and engagement but also identified potential publication biases. It emphasized the need for context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change education. Overall, the SSI approach helps develop proactive, environmentally conscious citizens capable of addressing global issues. The seventh article is from USA. The study investigated the impact of an active project-based, aquaculture constructivist-learning program on high school students' perceptions. It aimed to determine if the program influenced students' interest, engagement, and future educational and career aspirations in STEM fields, both inside and outside the classroom. The study also sought to understand students' knowledge about aquaculture and skill development post-program participation. Qualitative data were gathered through post-student focus groups, teacher journal reflections, and public newspaper articles from three rural high schools in Kentucky. Four main themes emerged: (1) students demonstrated excitement and enthusiasm in the hands-on aquaculture program; (2) students exhibited attention to detail in aquaculture tasks, leading to increased responsibility; (3) students engaged collaboratively with their peers; and (4) there was a greater interest and confidence in STEM through practical application. The results indicated that the program engaged learners in real-world problem-solving and decision-making situations, fostering collaboration and enhancing skills such as responsibility and self-confidence in STEM. The eighth article is from Thailand. This research assessed the ability of Thai grade 10 students to construct scientific explanations and explored differences based on learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study involved 231 students from Phetchaburi province, Thailand, with 77.5% demonstrating moderate ability levels. Significant differences were found in students' ability levels based on their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study also revealed correlations between students' ability levels and their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. Students with higher learning achievement, positive attitudes, and attendance at larger schools tended to have higher ability levels. However, there was no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward science and school size. These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual differences and backgrounds, particularly in terms of learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size, when teaching science. The ninth article is from United Arab Emirates (UAE). This mixed-approach study explores the effects of virtual science laboratories on students' motivation and attitude toward science. Conducted in an American curriculum private school in Dubai, the research surveyed 237 students from grades 7 to 11. Results show that virtual laboratories positively impact students' overall motivation, including intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, effort, perceived self-efficacy, and attitude toward science. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived usefulness significantly influence students' attitudes toward science, with perceived self-efficacy being a predictor of their effort. The tenth article is from South Africa. This study examines the effectiveness of Khan Academy Videos (KAVs) in rural thermodynamics education. 88 students were divided into two groups: one taught traditionally (control group [CG]) and the other using KAVs (experimental group [EG]). Results show significant improvement in learning outcomes and engagement with KAVs, with EG scores increasing by 61% compared to 31% in the CG. Pre-tests and post-tests were used to measure academic performance, and a mixed-method approach analyzed results and feedback. The study highlights the positive impact of KAV integration on student performance, especially in resource-limited rural schools, suggesting its transformative potential in enhancing teaching quality. The eleventh article is from China. The article analyzes 30 documents from Web of Science and CNKI databases to compare and understand the role of science teachers in China and overseas. The research highlights slow development in both Chinese and English publications, with most studies in theoretical exploration. The role of science teachers encompasses five main aspects: Role expectation, role orientation, role identification, role transformation, and role enactment. Combining the \"should be\" research from Chinese publications with the \"real\" research from English publications could lead to a more comprehensive understanding and positive interaction. This analysis provides a basis for future research on the role of science teachers. As a final remark, the Science Education In",

        "abstract": "Background: Audiovisual distraction is a potentially good technique to reduce medical treatment procedure-related fear and anxiety among children. However, few studies have assessed its effectiveness. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction in reducing pain anxiety in pediatrics. Methods: Randomized control trials and experimental studies that reported the use of audiovisual distraction during medical/dental treatments among children aged 3–8 years, used the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale to assess pain, and were published between 2005–2021 and in English were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used for evidence analysis. Results: A total of four studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis: two were from South Asia and one each were from Africa and North America. Three of these studies were randomized control trials. The variability among the studies was high. Three of the four studies found that AV techniques were significantly effective in reducing pain during procedures compared with the control group (P < 0.00001), while one study found no difference; the cumulative evidence in the forest plot was similar. Conclusion: Cumulative evidence suggests that the use of audiovisual distraction is an effective strategy in reducing medical/dental procedures-related pain anxiety among children aged 3–8 years. However, evidence on this is currently limited, and thus further studies are required using various AD techniques and on different populations to substantiate these findings. Funding: None.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nSome blood operators routinely screen blood donations for high-titre (HT) anti-A/B to reduce the risk of a haemolytic transfusion reaction due to out-of-group plasma-rich components. We assessed donor factors associated with an increased likelihood of screening positive and compared routine data between England and Australia.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData were assessed from HT screening during 2018-2020 in Australia and 2018-2021 in England, totalling nearly 6 million blood donations. Screening was performed using a Beckman Coulter PK7300 analyser with a micro-titre plate saline direct agglutination test in both countries, although different reagent red cells were chosen. HT-positive was defined as testing positive at a titre of 128 or above.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe likelihood of a donor testing HT-positive was greater for females than males, declined with age and was dependent on the ABO group. However, the proportion of donors testing HT-positive was consistently higher in Australia than in England: overall, 14% of group O donations and 5% of group A donations in England tested HT-positive, compared with 51% and 22%, respectively in Australia. English data also showed that donors from Black, Asian or mixed ethnic backgrounds were more likely to test HT-positive than White donors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data demonstrate that donor sex, age, ABO group and ethnicity affect the likelihood of testing HT-positive. Differences in testing methods likely had a significant impact on the proportion of donors testing as HT-positive or -negative rather than any differences in donor populations.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Tobacco consumption and its impact on health remain high worldwide. Additionally, it is a contentious issue generating significant controversy. Twitter has proven to be a useful platform for evaluating public health topics related to population health behaviors, and tobacco consumption. Objective The objective of this study is to analyze the content of tweets related to tobacco. Moreover, geolocation data will be considered to understand regional differences. Methods Tweets published between 2018 and 2022, in both English and Spanish, containing the keyword “tobacco,” were analyzed. A total of 56,926 tweets were obtained. The tweets were classified into different categories. 550 tweets were manually analyzed, and an automated and computerized classification was performed for the remaining and largest subset of tweets. Results The analysis yielded 30,812 classifiable tweets. Healthcare professionals were the most frequent contributors to the topic (50.2%), with the most common theme being general information about the toxic effects of tobacco. 57.9% of the tweets discussed the harmful effects of tobacco on health, with fear being the predominant emotion. The largest number of tweets were located in America. Conclusions Our study revealed a substantial number of tweets highlighting the health risks and negative perceptions of tobacco consumption. Africa showed the lowest percentage of tweets discussing the health risks associated with tobacco, coinciding with the continent having the least developed anti-tobacco policies. Healthcare professionals emerged as the most prominent users discussing the topic, which is encouraging as they play a crucial role in disseminating accurate and scientific health information.",

        "abstract": "Among Arab-American women in Michigan, rates of cervical cancer screening are lower than those in non-Hispanic White and Black women in the state. A deep understanding of the Arab community’s perspective on cervical cancer screening is needed to address the disparity in rates across populations in Michigan. Arab and Chaldean women across Michigan were invited to participate in Zoom-based focus groups to understand the attitudes, acceptability, and barriers of cervical cancer screening among this population. Four focus groups with a total of 19 women aged 30 to 61 were conducted. The focus groups were conducted in English, Arabic, or both languages. The guided discussion was focused on knowledge of cervical cancer and Human papillomavirus (HPV) and its transmission, attitudes towards HPV vaccination, and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening. HPV self-sampling as an alternative to traditional provider-based screening was specifically discussed as this has been proposed as a way to increase screening in hard-to-reach populations. The conversations revealed insights related to barriers at the individual and community levels for screening and vaccination, attitudes towards preventive health care including screening, a need for accessible women’s health literature, and health education. The women also discussed vaccine hesitancy related to HPV and COVID-19, suggesting a need for targeted community interventions.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of sociolinguistic research, African American Language (AAL) remains stigmatized throughout the United States education system. There have been proposals to counteract this through curricula and/or ideological interventions targeted at teachers that seek to validate AAL while maintaining Dominant American English (DAE) as an educational target. However, such approaches have been criticized for giving limited attention to combating the racism that underlies much linguistic marginalization. We used a mixed‐methods approach to explore the benefits and limitations of a dialect‐shifting curriculum in shaping teachers' language ideologies. Participants (n = 40) were K‐1 teachers in a predominantly Black mid‐Atlantic city. They were participating in an efficacy study of a dialect‐shifting curriculum; schools were randomly assigned to teach the curriculum (intervention condition) or continue with business as usual. Before and after the intervention, teachers completed a survey of their language attitudes, and a subset (n = 16) participated in semi‐structured interviews. On the survey, teachers displayed more favorable attitudes toward language variation at the end of the school year, regardless of condition. The interviews revealed a range of perspectives, revealing a tension between a belief in the utility of DAE for their students and an understanding that many students will wish to use AAL in their communities. The curriculum provided shared vocabulary to discuss this tension and increased some teachers' acceptance of AAL in non‐academic settings, but many did not view dialect variation as relevant to their priorities as K‐1 teachers. These findings clarify the trade‐offs involved in work toward a more (linguistically) inclusive education system.",

        "title": "EFFECT OF BILINGUAL INSTRUCTIONAL METHOD IN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN MATHEMATICS",
        "abstract": "The importance of mathematics in the modern society is overwhelming. The importance of mathematics has long been recognized all over the world, and that is why all students are required to study mathematics at the primary and secondary school levels, whether they have the aptitude for it or not (Ojo, 2015; Adebayo, 2008; Adeleke, 2007). However, despite the importance of mathematics in the Nigerian education system, the students’ performances continue to deteriorate year after year. Several reasons have been proffered for the high failure rate in mathematics. Given the options, many students will not offer mathematics (Agwagah, 2013). Agwagah noted that an increasing number of students find it difficult to do well in mathematics because of the teaching method used in teaching most of the themes are not interesting. In other words, the prime position accorded mathematics in the society is at risk because of persistent poor performance. According to Kurumeh and Achor (2008), the difficulties of students in learning mathematics could be attributed to the approach to which the contents are being presented to the students, the abstractness of mathematical concepts, and poor foundation, among others. Most students, especially, at the Junior Secondary School (JSS) have difficulties in understanding mathematics because of the language of instruction (which is English Language) (Ifeanacho, 2012). Majority of the students who are highly proficient in performing mathematical operations, in solving symbolic problems are less proficient in solving problems when it is algebraic (Iji, Abakpa, & Takor, 2015).In recent years, the language of instruction has become an active focus of investigation in education research, including research in mathematics education. Such focus is a symptom of a relatively recent paradigmatic shift whose main characteristics are a new understanding of the student and increasing awareness of the learning contexts, such as, notably the complexities arising from cultural and linguistic diversity (Radford & Barwell, 2022). When students’ conceptualizations are perceived to be incorrect, language is often then seen as an obstacle or barrier to the effective communication of the desired knowledge or structures. Language, however, is clearly more than a hindrance or an obstacle; language, talk, text and the production and interpretation of symbols are integral to the creation of learning, teaching and assessment, particularly in mathematics. The contributions of language, the politics of discourse, and critical studies, with most emphasis on the issue of multilingual classrooms need the urgent attention of education stakeholders. Multilingualism is the ability to speak two or more languages fluently. There are many benefits of multilingualism, such as improving cognitive, social, emotional, and economic skills. Multilingualism does not seem to have a significant impact on mathematical reasoning or problem-solving. However, multilingual students who are allowed to use many languages to discuss and solve problems have increased mathematical productivity, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Teachers working in a multilingual setting should be aware that the use of the first language may have a great influence on mathematics learning, especially when the students are involved in cognitively complex issues. The study of multilingual mathematics learners requires theoretical notions that address not only the cognitive and domain-specific aspects of learning mathematics but also the linguistic and cross-cultural nature of this work.Multilingualism has multiple benefits for students, such as giving them an academic advantage and improving their employment prospects once they leave school. Moreover, multilingualism gives them access to more than one culture and improves their understanding of different cultures and languages (Halai & Clarkson, 2016). Language plays a crucial role in learning amidst a multilingual classroom (Adetuyi, 2017). Essien (2018) opined that learning of mathematics is through language, and involves reading, writing, listening and discussion, all of which are heavily language-based activities. Natural language and language of mathematics play different roles. With their own specificities, each of them provides individuals with access to different layers of mathematical consciousness. They provide individuals with different forms of expressiveness and aesthetic experience. Several studies (e.g. Atweh, Bose, Graven, Subramanian & Venkat, 2014) noted the concerns about primary school students’ poor achievement in numeracy across many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Essien (2018) observed that various mathematics education research on multilingualism point to the intricate link between language competence and mathematics classroom practices. However, systematic review of literature on multilingualism (e.g. Setati, Chitera & Essien, 2009; Essien, 2018) found insignificant number of publications that focused on multilingual classroom practices and students’ achievement. In addition, research on the role of language in multilingual primary school level was insignificant compared to the role of language in mathematics at other levels of education. While literature has focused on pedagogical practices, role of language and conceptual framework necessary to support teaching and learning in a multilingual classroom ( e.g. Freeman & Freeman, 2014; Viesca & Teemant, 2019). Van Laren and Goba (2013) suggested that when teaching mathematics to second language students, teachers should introduce two languages simultaneously for clarity of the mathematical terms and concepts for good academic achievement. Kasma Suwanarak (2014) opined that balanced-language instruction to some extent promote academic achievement in bilingual students. Hence, the more bilingual experience and the more balanced exposure to both of their languages the students have, the more advantages they gain for promoting their learning success.The importance of language in the teaching and learning of mathematics can never be over emphasized. Teaching mathematics with two languages most especially with the local language can increase the rate of comprehension by the students. Different ways of understanding learning contribute to our knowledge of the relationship between language and mathematics in bilingual classrooms. According to Moschkovich, (2007) the relationship between language and mathematics in research began in the field of psychology and examined the cognitive functioning of bilingual learners during arithmetic computations and the solving of word problems.Achievement is the result, the successfulness, the extent or ability, the progress in learning educational experiences that the individual indicate in relation with his/her educational learning (Olga, 2008). Achievement in mathematics, which is the focus of this study, is viewed as a very important factor in teaching and learning of mathematics and it refers to students’ cognitive achievement and psychomotor skills, which are measured in terms of pass or fail (Adebayo, 2008; Popoola & Ajani, 2011). When achievement is below expectation, it is referred to as under-achievement or poor achievement. When students are successful in examination they will have the feeling of pride that they made success with their own efforts and skill. Small success can give students sense of achievement. On the other hand, persistent failure dampens students’ interest.",

        "abstract": "Background In High-Income Countries (HICs) HIV/AIDS continues to disproportionally affect Black Women of African Descent (BWAD) and other racialized groups and is now a major public health concern. Despite the multiple efforts, evidence is limited on the effectiveness of HIV interventions to address the HIV outcomes inequalities among BWAD. This protocol outlines the methodological process of a systematic review that will gather quantitative and qualitative data to examine existing determinants of effective HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions to address the HIV outcomes disparities and inequities among BWAD in HICs. Methods A systematic review of eligible articles will be conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature will be made in MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO Host), and Global Health (Ovid). Peer-reviewed studies involving the experience of BWAD in HICs; different HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions both in the community and in a clinical setting; studies that report on the experience of BWAD on HIV intervention/ service including different levels of barriers and facilitators; reports of original research and peer-reviewed articles based on qualitative, quantitative, and mixed study designs published in English from 1980 onwards in HICs will be included. A narrative synthesis, thematic synthesis, and descriptive quantitative analysis of both extracted qualitative and quantitative data will be undertaken. Conclusion Substantial changes including tailored interventions are needed to address the inequities in HIV outcomes that disproportionally impact BWAD in HICs. Understanding the determinants of the effectiveness of BWAD-focused HIV interventions is critical to stemming the HIV epidemic and reducing the burden of the disease and poor health outcomes experienced by BWAD in HICs Our study finding will inform the multi level and multisectoral stakeholder including public health, community-based organizations and nongovernmental civil society organization engaged in BWAD HIV and health policy and practice in HICs. Findings from this review will be used to guide effective response to HIV/AIDS using an equity-driven policy and practice framework. Trial registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023458938.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of area-based deprivation and ethnicity in the increased risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM), in primiparous women in England. Methods A retrospective nationwide population study was conducted using English National Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database. All primiparous women were included if they gave birth in an National Healthcare Service (NHS) hospital in England between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2021. Logistic regression was used to examine the relative odds of SMM by Index of Multiple Deprivation and ethnicity, adjusting for age and health behaviours, medical and psychological factors. Results The study population comprised 1 178 756 primiparous women. Neighbourhood deprivation increased the risk of SMM at the time of childbirth. In the fully adjusted model, there was a linear trend (p=0.001) between deprivation quintile and the odds of SMM. Being from a minoritised ethnic group also independently increased the risk of SMM, with black or black British African women having the highest risk, adjusted OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.70 to 2.00) compared with white women. There was no interaction between deprivation and ethnicity (p=0.49). Conclusion This study has highlighted that neighbourhood deprivation and ethnicity are important, independently associated risk factors for SMM.",

        "abstract": "Background Injuries are among the leading causes for hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. COVID-19 restrictions ensured safety to Canadians, but also negatively impacted health outcomes, including increasing rates of certain injuries. These differences in trends have been reported internationally however the evidence is scattered and needs to be better understood to identify opportunities for public education and to prepare for future outbreaks. Objective A scoping review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on unintentional injuries in Canada, compared to other countries. Methods Studies investigating unintentional injuries among all ages during COVID-19 from any country, published in English between December 2019 and July 2021, were included. Intentional injuries and/or previous pandemics were excluded. Four databases were searched (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus), and a gray literature search was also conducted. Results The search yielded 3,041 results, and 189 articles were selected for extraction. A total of 41 reports were included from the gray literature search. Final studies included research from: Europe (n = 85); North America (n = 44); Asia (n = 32); Oceania (n = 12); Africa (n = 8); South America (n = 4); and multi-country (n = 4). Most studies reported higher occurrence of injuries/trauma among males, and the average age across studies was 46 years. The following mechanisms of injury were reported on most frequently: motor vehicle collisions (MVCs; n = 134), falls (n = 104), sports/recreation (n = 65), non-motorized vehicle (n = 31), and occupational (n = 24). Injuries occurring at home (e.g., gardening, home improvement projects) increased, and injuries occurring at schools, workplaces, and public spaces decreased. Overall, decreases were observed in occupational injuries and those resulting from sport/recreation, pedestrian-related, and crush/trap incidents. Decreases were also seen in MVCs and burns, however the severity of injury from these causes increased during the pandemic period. Increases were observed in poisonings, non-motorized vehicle collisions, lacerations, drownings, trampoline injuries; and, foreign body ingestions. Implications Findings from this review can inform interventions and policies to identify gaps in public education, promote safety within the home, and decrease the negative impact of future stay-at-home measures on unintentional injury among Canadians and populations worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Malaria has inflicted serious morbidity and mortality across the globe. The major brunt of the disease has been on African, South-East Asian and South American countries. Proportionally, malaria has attracted global research priorities and this is evident from the number of publications related to malaria from across the globe, irrespective of its endemicity. However, formal and exhaustive analyses of these ‘malaria publications’ are rarely reported. The systematic review and secondary data analyses were done to retrieve information on what has been published on malaria, where is it published, and which countries are major contributors to malaria research. The study presents malaria publications from 1945 to 2020 retrieved using three databases: Web of Science^™, Embase^® and Scopus^®. Exported data were examined to determine the number of publications over time, their subject areas, contributions from various countries/organizations, and top publishing journals. The total number of published records on malaria ranged from 90,282 to 112,698 (due to three different databases). Based on the number of publications, USA, UK, France, and India were identified as the top four countries. Malaria Journal, American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, and PLoS One were the most preferred journals, whereas the University of London (Institutions other than LSHTM), the National Institute of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Oxford appeared to be the top contributing organization. A disproportional contribution to malaria research was observed with non-malaria endemic countries making the largest contribution. Databases differed in their output format and needed standardization to make the outputs comparable across databases.",

        "title": "Defining the Black population in Canadian health research: a scoping review protocol",
        "abstract": "Introduction In the context of health research in Canada, various terms and labels have been employed to reference the Black population. This practice has had the unintended consequence of diminishing the comparability and efficiency of studies. Furthermore, using a broad term such as ‘Black’ may fail to encompass the diversity and intricacy of the ethnocultural backgrounds of people who are racialised as such. It may also obscure the subtleties of their experiences and health outcomes. This study aims to examine how health researchers have defined Black within the scope of their work and different labels used to identify the Black population in Canada. Methods and analysis We have developed and employed a comprehensive and sensitive search strategy to identify articles concerning the health and wellness of the Black population in Canada. Both peer-reviewed and grey literature will be searched. Original articles published in both English and French will be included. The screening process will consist of two stages: the title and abstract screening, followed by a thorough examination of full-text articles. Additionally, single citation tracking and manual search of reference lists will be conducted. Study characteristics and relevant information on the definition of the Black population will be extracted, followed by reflective thematic analysis and presentation of the key findings. Ethics and dissemination This review will not require ethical approval. We will disseminate the results through meetings with stakeholders. From the beginning, a knowledge translation approach was decided upon following consultation with citizen researchers and community champions. Our findings will also be disseminated through oral and poster presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media.",

        "title": "Otherization and Identity Distortion in Dangarembga’s Writing",
        "abstract": "In spite of the fact that most African novelists, penning stories in English language by the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, were graduates of the British colonial missionaries and universities, they had yet been able to escape the suppressive ideology of colonization and become genuine mouthpieces for their native communities’ struggles and adversity. Amongst whom, the Zimbabwean Tsitsi Dangarembga rose to the fore as representative of her fellow countrywomen during the British colonization. Henceforth, concomitant with the rise of postcolonial criticism in the literary arena, this paper aims to address the European colonial mechanism of otherization and its impact on the identity construction of the otherized subject in Dangarembga’s novels, Nervous Conditions and The Book of Not. Dangarembga foreshadows the main thematic realm of her semi-autobiographical trilogy, through her first novel’s title which is reminiscent of Frantz Fanon’s preface in the book of The Wretched of the Earth. To unravel the intricate complexities of the colonizer/colonized contact, this study pinpoints the psychological confusion of the protagonist, Tambuzdai, as an exemplar of the colonized Black individual’s distress. To fathom the depth of Tambu’s psyche during those encounters, this paper relies on Elke Boehmer’s attribution of otherization as a Western self-projecting process that seeks to produce self-soothing and “dark mirror-images” of the other. In addition, Du Bois’s analysis of double consciousness seems to account for the protagonist’s identity crisis and self alienation. In conclusion, Dangarembga does not seem as an opponent of cultural exchanges in general or hybridity in particular, but she simply advocates cautious adaption that does not decentre and disregard one’s native-ness and cultural origins.",

        "abstract": "The main goal of this work is to reposition the concept of xenophobia in the African context. This is to reflect on Thabo Mbeki’s narrative on Xenophobia. Africa continues to remain a pawn due to the Eurocentric ideas that have been forced on the Africans also brought about a foreign concept of xenophobia as if Africans are not brothers in the name of brotherhood. It is incontestable that brothers are, in some cases engage in fight, but there was a laid down rules and norms of resolving such misunderstanding. With the employment of qualitative research methods, complex interdependence theory garnished with Anglo-American conspiracy theory; we argue that, Anglo-American imperialist managed to spread and enforce the usage of English through imposing the concept xenophobia in the continent while failing to capture the essence of sibling fights or fights amongst African brothers and sisters conceptualised by the Batswana speaking people as maragana teng a bana motho. Through acknowledging Mbeki’s narrative and some sampled African languages, we argue that, while there is a word for foreigner in these sampled African languages, there is no direct or indirect translation of xenophobia in African languages. We conclude that the concept xenophobia has its etymological foundations in Greek and is therefore foreign in any of the African and South African indigenous languages.",

Process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) is one of the teaching methods that promote problem-solving skills because it provides opportunities for learners to work with many formulae through many steps in solving problems such as stoichiometric calculations of number of moles and concentration of solutions. To understand how POGIL can improve learners’ achievement and develop problem-solving skills, four grade 11 physical sciences classes of mixed gender and multicultural black learners were purposefully and conventional sampled from four different township schools in Pretoria, South Africa. Through pre- and post-test case study and lesson observations, two different independent groups (POGIL group and lecture group) were included in the study. POGIL group constituted 48 students, while lecture group 62 students taught by their respective teachers at their schools for three weeks using English second language. The results from the pre-test suggest that learners in all the four classes lacked problem-solving competencies in solving both the low-order and the high-order stoichiometry questions. According to the research interpretation, lesson observations of POGIL were active learning while lecture method was passive learning. The post-test results indicate statistically significant greater problem-solving competencies in POGIL group than in the lecture group. The study recommends the use of POGIL in teaching stoichiometry.",

        "abstract": "Aims A large body of evidence suggests that experiences of, and access to mental healthcare in England varies according to ethnicity. Inequitable use of restrictive interventions is of particular concern, including within perinatal services: a national-level study of inpatients on Mother and Baby Units (MBU) in 2017 found that 28% of white patients were detained under the mental health act (MHA), compared with 61.5% of Black African, and 66 – 77% of Asian mothers. We carried out an audit with the aim of examining detention rates, length of stay, and time to first section 17 leave on an MBU in South Manchester according to ethnicity and English language ability, to compare with national averages. Methods We identified all patients discharged from Andersen Ward (an MBU) between March 2022 and March 2023. Using electronic medical records we extracted information on: ethnicity, language spoken (English vs other), mental health act status (detained under Section 2/3 vs informal), duration of admission, date of detention, date of first Section 17 leave. We calculated the percentage of patients who were detained according to ethnicity (White British, Mixed/other, Asian, Black), and the odds of detention according to ethnicity. Statistical significance was assessed using chi-squared testing. We also compared average length of stay and time to first section 17 leave by ethnicity. Results 74 patients had been discharged from the MBU within the audit period. 88% of Black inpatients were admitted under the Mental Health act, compared with 72.7% of Asian mothers, 33.3% of Mixed ethnicity or other ethnicities and 28.3% of white mothers. Differences in detention rates according to ethnicity were statistically significant. Of 11 mothers documented as having a language other than English as their primary language, all had been detained. Length of admission and days to first section 17 leave were not significantly different between ethnicities. Conclusion Many factors may contribute to the observed higher detention rates among non-White patients: language barriers and a lack of intercultural competence could lead to risk-averse decision-making during MHA assessments, and different help-seeking patterns might mean White mothers seek help earlier, or for less severe mental health problems. Recommendations include expanding access to high-quality interpreters; investigating factors underlying MHA decision-making through qualitative research; and improving cultural competence among section 12 approved clinicians by incorporating feedback from ethnic minority patients into training and refresher courses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Despite the high prevalence of headaches in pediatric patients with brain tumors, very little research has been done to characterize their traits and to assess current management practices. Effective and efficient treatment of these headaches is critical to the optimization of brain tumor survivors’ quality of life. Foundational knowledge of any clinical associations likely would be beneficial to develop rational management strategies. METHODS A retrospective single-institution chart review of pediatric patients seen in the Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO) Neuro-oncology clinic from 1/1/22-12/31/22 is underway. Information is being collected via manual chart review including basic demographic information, oncologic diagnosis and tumor location, surgical interventions, and tumor-directed treatments. Headache characteristics, including timing of onset, associated symptoms, severity and frequency, referral to CHCO Neurology Headache Clinic and any headache therapies attempted will be sought. Additional information will include the number of emergency department visits and unplanned MRIs obtained as part of headache management. RESULTS 384 patients (53% male; median age 12 years, range 2-24 years) received care in the CHCO Neuro-oncology clinic in 2022. The majority of these patients were Caucasian/Non-Hispanic (61.7%), followed by Caucasian/Hispanic (13.8%) and African American/Non-Hispanic (4.2%). In this cohort, the preferred language for 93% was English and for 6% was Spanish. The majority (55%) of patients had a low-grade glioma/ glioneuronal tumor as their oncologic diagnosis. Patients with referrals to CHCO Headache clinic made up 13% of this cohort. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS This data set will help to characterize the prevalence and features of headaches in pediatric patients with CNS tumors. This information will serve as the foundation for planned prospective studies that will collect more comprehensive and consistent data related to headaches in the pediatric neuro-oncology population and to formalize processes that will identify appropriate patients for referral to specialized headache providers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates how and whether speakers of endangered languages employ variation as a stylistic resource to make social meaning and index their identities. The study is set in historically Creole-speaking communities in rural Louisiana, which have now shifted almost completely to English. The Americanization of Louisiana induced language shift, but also a shift to the Anglo-American racial binary which supplanted local constructs of ethnicity and race. The study crafts a historical-sociolinguistic account of this process of Americanization, examining how linguistic differentiation was enacted through the enregisterment of iconic ‘Creole’/‘French’ variants as indexical links to the ‘Black’/‘White’ racial binary. Today, to a very limited extent, some speakers of Louisiana Creole still consider some variants socially meaningful and employ them to stylistic ends. This depends especially on racial identity and the variant in question. Subject pronouns retain some indexical value, occasionally employed stylistically by speakers racialized as White. However, front vowel rounding has fossilized: highly meaningful in the early-20th century, its social meaning has been lost resulting in synchronic personal-pattern variation. The paper ends by trying to reconcile classic studies of Language Death with contemporary variationist critique, answering recent calls for more nuanced approaches to sociolinguistic variation in threatened languages.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines depends on widespread vaccine uptake. Employing a telephone-administered weighted survey with 19,502 participants, we examined the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among adults in Texas. We used multiple regression analysis with LASSO-selected variables to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and intentions to receive the vaccine among the unvaccinated. The prevalence of unvaccinated individuals (22%) was higher among those aged 18–39, males, White respondents, English speakers, uninsured individuals, those facing financial challenges, and individuals expressing no concern about contracting the illness. In a fully adjusted regression model, higher odds of being unvaccinated were observed among males (aOR 1.11), the uninsured (aOR 1.38), smokers (aOR 1.56), and those facing financial struggles (aOR 1.62). Conversely, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics were less likely to be unvaccinated compared to Whites. Among the unvaccinated, factors associated with stronger intent to receive the vaccine included age (over 65 years), Black and Hispanic ethnicity, and perceived risk of infection. Hispanic individuals, the uninsured, those covered by public insurance, and those facing financial challenges were more likely to encounter barriers to vaccine receipt. These findings underscore the importance of devising tailored strategies, emphasizing nuanced approaches that account for demographic, socioeconomic, and attitudinal factors in vaccine distribution and public health interventions.",

This study aimed to identify the forms of code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song you never know by black pink, identify the types of code mixing used in the song lyrics, and describe the source language of the code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song. The method used in this study was content analysis, which was a qualitatively oriented technique, usually used to determine the character of documents or to compare them. The conclusion obtained from this study was the forms of code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song You Never Know by Blackpink consisting of inserting words, phrases and clauses. Code mixing in the form of words totaling 8 data, phrases totaling 20 data and clauses totaling 10 data. The type of code mixing used in the lyrics of the song you never know by Blackpink was alternation code mixing. The outer code mixing used was 8 data. The source language contained in the lyrics of the song You Never Know by Blackpink came from English and Korean. The code-mixed from English language was 26 data and Korean was 44 data.

        "abstract": "Introduction Black and Latinx communities experience inequities in the social determinants of health (SDOH) and high rates of chronic illnesses [e.g., cardiovascular disease (CVD), HIV]. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified these long-standing SDOH disparities. However, scant attention has been paid to the pandemic-related experiences of populations exposed to structural inequities. Methods Using a semi-structured interview guide, 60 in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with Black and Latinx people living with HIV (PLWH) and CVD risks to assess: (1) perceived personal and community risk for COVID-19; (2) knowledge of and access to COVID-19 public health information; (3) barriers to COVID-19 public health recommendations and vaccine uptake; and (4) perceptions of HIV, CVD, and COVID-19. Interviews were professionally transcribed into either English or Spanish. Spanish transcripts were translated into English. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to summarize each transcript into a structured templaicte corresponding to interview guide domains. Summaries were combined into matrices for identification and comparison of themes across domains. Results Participants reported risks for COVID-19 due to being immunocompromised and SDOH, including transportation, exposure to risks conferred by others, living in under-resourced neighborhoods, and housing insecurity. Participants engaged in protective countermeasures by adhering to public health mandates. Relationships with providers, participating in community support groups, and digital inclusion and literacy were salient with respect to dissemination of COVID-19 information and vaccine uptake. Experiences with managing a chronic illness facilitated vaccine acceptance. Participants described language barriers, experiences of discrimination, and a historical lack of trust in medical systems and vaccines. Discussion This study provides a real-time narrative from PLWH and CVD risks who were vulnerable during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications include the need for continuity with providers and established community networks, increasing internet access and digital health literacy, and addressing historical trauma incurred in medical settings. It is critical to understand the impact of traditional SDOH on those living with chronic illness as well as other social determinants that shed light on access to public health information, adherence to public health recommendations, and vaccine uptake among populations exposed to structural inequities.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by disparities in disease burden and medical care provision. Whether these disparities extend to long COVID awareness and receipt of medical care is unknown. We aimed to characterize awareness of long COVID and receipt of medical care for long COVID symptoms among populations who experience disparities in the United States (US). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a national sample of US adults between January 26–February 5, 2023. We surveyed approximately 2,800 adults drawn from the Ipsos probability-based KnowledgePanel® who identify as White, Black, or Hispanic, with over-sampling of Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-proficient adults. Awareness of long COVID was assessed with the question, “Have you heard of long COVID? This is also referred to as post-COVID, Long-haul COVID, Post-acute COVID-19, or Chronic COVID.” Respondents reporting COVID-19 symptoms lasting longer than 1 month were classified as having long COVID and asked about receipt of medical care. Results Of the 2,828 respondents, the mean age was 50.4 years, 52.8% were female, 40.2% identified as Hispanic, 29.8% as Black, and 26.7% as White. 18% completed the survey in Spanish. Overall, 62.5% had heard of long COVID. On multivariate analysis, long COVID awareness was lower among respondents who identified as Black (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51, 0.81), Hispanic and completed the survey in English (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46, 0.76), and Hispanic and completed the survey in Spanish (OR 0.31, 95% C.I. 0.23, 0.41), compared to White respondents (overall p < 0.001). Long COVID awareness was also associated with educational attainment, higher income, having health insurance, prior history of COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination. Among those reporting symptoms consistent with long COVID (n = 272), 26.8% received medical care. Older age, longer symptom duration and greater symptom impact were associated with receipt of medical care for long COVID symptoms. Of those who received care, most (77.8%) rated it as less than excellent on a 5-point scale. Discussion This survey reveals limited awareness of long COVID and marked disparities in awareness according to race, ethnicity, and language. Targeted public health campaigns are needed to raise awareness.",

        "title": "The every woman study™ low- and middle-income countries edition protocol: A multi-country observational study to assess opportunities and challenges to improving survival and quality of life for women with ovarian cancer",
        "abstract": "Background Ovarian cancer is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat effectively with five-year survival rates below 50%. Previous patient experience research in high-income countries highlighted common challenges and opportunities to improve survival and quality of life for women affected by ovarian cancer. However, no comparable data exist for low-and middle-income countries, where 70% of women with the disease live. This study aims to address this evidence gap. Methods This is an observational multi-country study set in low- and middle-income countries. We aim to recruit over 2000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer across multiple hospitals in 24 countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Country sample sizes have been calculated (n = 70–96 participants /country), taking account of varying national five-year disease prevalence rates. Women within five years of their diagnosis, who are in contact with participating hospitals, are invited to take part in the study. A questionnaire has been adapted from a tool previously used in high-income countries. It comprises 57 multiple choice and two open-ended questions designed to collect information on demographics, women’s knowledge of ovarian cancer, route to diagnosis, access to treatments, surgery and genetic testing, support needs, the impact of the disease on women and their families, and their priorities for action. The questionnaire has been designed in English, translated into local languages and tested according to local ethics requirements. Questionnaires will be administered by a trained member of the clinical team. Conclusion This study will inform further research, advocacy, and action in low- and middle-income countries based on tailored approaches to the national, regional and global challenges and opportunities. In addition, participating countries can choose to repeat the study to track progress and the protocol can be adapted for other countries and other diseases.",

        "abstract": "The responses of labour markets to global pandemics are attracting renewed interest, although the English labour laws in response to the Black Death of 1348/9 – capping wages, imposing annual contracts, and restricting mobility – have a long and established scholarship. The conventional wisdom is that the legislation represented an extension of existing local practices and created common cause among all categories of employer. Yet this view is hard to reconcile with the fact that, despite subsequent revisions, the legislation soon failed. These arguments are tested through original research into how the legislation was actually enforced in a variety of legal tribunals (manorial, borough, and royal). A clear distinction is maintained between public presentments and private litigation, and a robust methodology is pursued to record their absence as well as quantifying their presence. This casts new light on the novelty of the labour laws, the reasons for their failure, and their influence on contract law. The analysis exemplifies the potential for short‐term legal responses to infectious diseases to have unintended and unanticipated long‐term consequences.",

        "abstract": "The black-veined white butterfly, Aporia crataegi, reached the north-western edge of its European geographic distribution in the British Isles in the 19th century, but became extinct in the early 20th century, following several cold decades. Substantial areas of potential breeding habitat in southern Britain are currently available to this species, which requires scattered hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and suckering blackthorn scrub (Prunus spinosa), including infrequently cut hedgerows. These habitats are needed at a relatively large scale as the butterfly occurs as networks of colonies (metapopulations), ranging over large tracts of connected landscape. A number of events have increased habitat availability over the past 70 years (myxomatosis reduced rabbit populations, which permitted host plant scrub regeneration; hedgerow management policies reduced cutting frequencies; rewilding and landscape connectivity initiatives are resulting in additional scrub). However, while A. crataegi males occasionally disperse several kilometres, it is unlikely that A. crataegi females will cross the English Channel in sufficient numbers to establish populations in southern England, without assistance. Here, we (i) provide a review of the literature on species interactions, the habitat requirements, distribution and dispersal of A. crataegi and (ii) provide evidence that southern, eastern and central England are likely to be climatically suitable for reintroductions of A. crataegi. Substantial areas of England are already expected to be amongst the climatically most suitable parts of Europe for this insect. We identify a landscape of at least 100 km2 containing multiple patches of suitable habitats, and highlight co-benefits for other species that inhabit scrubland and successional mosaics. We use a climate-matching approach to assess climatically-similar locations to obtain source material most likely to establish in Britain. Areas of northern France and mid elevations in the Iberian Peninsula, including in the Pyrenees, provide potential suitable source locations due to close climatic matching and a large number of species records. We recommend reestablishment from more than one source, providing genetic diversity in the reintroduced population, enabling subsequent local adaptation to British conditions. We highlight the opportunity for monitored releases to be undertaken within the landscape highlighted here, so as to evaluate population growth, host plant use, and rates of colonisation away from release sites that differ in their management, habitat, host plant characteristics, and proximity to other sites. This approach would aim to develop knowledge as a ‘living lab’ to inform future ‘best practice’ releases. In conclusion, the black-veined white, A. crataegi, has potential to become a model species for assisted colonisation projects where natural and human-created barriers have prevented range expansion into regions where the 21st century climate is suitable for a species.",

(2011) supported that characteristics found in AAE help avoid commonly observed developmental errors in the comprehension of wh-questions. Prior work on mainstream American English (MAE) has shown that where and what are acquired before who, how, why, which, and when. Research on passive voice revealed that children comprehend action verb passives earlier than non-action verb passives. We investigate the comprehen­sion of wh-questions and passive voice in 222 SAAE-, SE- and MAE-speaking children, aged 2-13 and examine whether there were certain structural environments where we examined the comprehension of wh-questions or passive voice that were more challenging for the three groups. The results show that SE and SAAE have comparable development with wh-questions and passive voice, with minor exceptions. They confirm findings from previous studies on both the order of acquisition of wh-questions and the earlier acquisition of action passives, as well as the SAAE-speaking participants’ highly accurate performance with wh-questions, especially structures which include indirect/medial questions.",

Wikipedia materials are proliferated across the Internet of Things, are reused in journalism and social media, and power search engines and digital assistants (Ribeiro et al. 2021; Miz et al. 2020). Yet Wikipedia’s impact on public understanding of the past, particularly our medieval pasts, is under-researched. This article argues for the significance of Wikipedia for medievalists in terms of how it may shape research, pedagogy, and public-facing work. We examine three case studies—articles for the ‘Black Death,’ the ‘Viking Age,’ and ‘Old English literature’—to explore how the medieval is forged, defined by us as crafted and created, ‘on-Wiki.’ We discuss what these forgings suggest about public understanding, desires, and interests, and the ideas about the past that emerge as a result. Our case studies demonstrate varied approaches to Wiki content, including citation review, readings of version histories, and pageview analysis. It is intended that this article provokes further discussion of Wikipedia as a site of medieval public history and inspires our colleagues to engage as critics, editors, teachers, or activists.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was used to measure population levels of conceptual alignment among two polar sensory metaphors and clusters of concepts to which they are commonly applied. A total of 873 participants were tested online, to compare within- and between-cluster alignments of concepts associated with two different polar sensory metaphors (up/down and black/white). IAT results were sensitive to semantic alignments that were also picked up by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) using a large-scale corpus of English. However, even with these semantic alignments taken into account, the dual categorization results demonstrated strong metaphor-cluster alignments over and above the predictions of LSA. It is proposed that, rather than ontogenetic development of metaphoric concepts based on sensorimotor experience, conventionalized sensorimotor metaphors in language may be cognitive tools that provide language learners with insights supported by conceptual properties of a phylogenetically evolved perceptual interface.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Transcription of conjoined independent clauses within language samples varies across professionals. Some transcribe these clauses as two separate utterances, whereas others conjoin them within a single utterance. As an inquiry into equitable practice, we examined rates of conjoined independent clauses produced by children and the impact of separating these clauses within utterances on measures of mean length of utterance (MLU) by a child's English dialect, clinical status, and age. Method: The data were archival and included 246 language samples from children classified by their dialect (African American English or Southern White English) and clinical status (developmental language disorder [DLD] or typically developing [TD]), with those in the TD group further classified by their age (4 years [TD4] or 6 years [TD6]). Results: Rates of conjoined independent clauses and the impact of these clauses on MLU varied by clinical status (DLD < TD) and age (TD4 < TD6), but not by dialect. Correlations between the rate of conjoined clauses, MLU, and language test scores were also similar across the two dialects. Conclusions: Transcription decisions regarding conjoined independent clauses within language samples lead to equitable measurement outcomes across dialects of English. Nevertheless, transcribing conjoined independent clauses as two separate utterances reduces one's ability to detect syntactic differences between children with and without DLD and document syntactic growth as children age.

        "abstract": "Purpose: Syntax provides critical support for both academic success and linguistic growth, yet it has not been a focus of language research in school-age African American children. This study examines complex syntax performance of African American children in second through fifth grades. Method: The current study explores the syntactic performances of African American children (N = 513) in Grades 2–5 on the Test of Language Development–Intermediate who speak African American English. Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the growth and associated changes between dialect density and syntax. Analyzed data were compared both to the normative sample and within the recruited sample. Results: The results suggest that dialect density exerted its impact early but did not continue to influence syntactic growth over time. Additionally, it was not until dialect density was accounted for in growth models that African American children's syntactic growth resembled normative expectations of a standardized language instrument. Conclusion: The current study suggests that failure to consider cultural language differences obscures our understanding of African American students' linguistic competence on standardized language assessments.",

        "abstract": "Dear readers, \nI am pleased to introduce the 2023 Issue of the International Journal of Child and Adolescent Resilience (IJCAR). This issue includes: two regular articles on trauma and maltreatment and associated impacts; three brief reports on varying aspects of hardships and resilience in different populations; and one theoretical paper about a narrative shelter model to give youth who experienced violence a voice and choice. \nIn particular, the regular articles shed light on hardships and resilience experienced by differing populations. Bégin and colleagues examined the effects of using the internet survey method compared to a population-based telephone survey method on the profile of women with a history of child sexual abuse, in terms of socio-demographic data, victimization experiences, and mental health symptoms in adulthood. Jamison and colleagues aimed to gain insights on youth of color in the United States who have experienced violence regarding the associations between resilience and psychological health, social support, and school engagement. \nFurthermore, the 2023 issue of IJCAR also includes three brief reports on different topics associated to experiences of trauma, maltreatment, and resilience in various populations. Firstly, Brend et al. compared a sample of Finnish social workers serving children and families or social workers in other domains, in terms of the associations between moral distress and burnout amongst these groups. Secondly, Frederickson et al. investigated whether child maltreatment predicted the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and symptom clusters for Canadian women during pregnancy, as well as changes in symptoms from pregnancy to three months postpartum. Finally, Souza et al. aimed to determine if social media in Brazil is a viable outlet for the dissemination of empirically supported information surrounding the topics of child abuse, adverse childhood events, and resilience. \nFinally, the issue ends with a theoretical paper by Nyirinkwaya and Jenney, regarding a shelter narrative model for research and practice on childhood experiences of intimate partner violence in young people, in order to integrate storytelling and storylistening to help youth exercise their voice and choice. Thus, we encourage you to read these various articles to obtain rich information about ongoing research in the field of resilience. \nI wish to also take this opportunity to sincerely thank all the members of the IJCAR team for their continuous and dedicated work in the editing and publishing process. Particularly, I wish to thank our associate editors, Dr. Tara Black, Dr. Delphine Collin-Vézina, Dr. Isabelle Daigneault, Dr. Rachel Langevin, and Dr. Nicole Racine; layout editor, Manon Robichaud; and managing editor and senior copyeditor, Teresa Pirro, all of which have done a fantastic job in their varying roles. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Dr. Roxanne Guyon as a new associate editor. We hope you enjoy reading the current issue! \nThis is also a friendly reminder to prepare your manuscripts for the next issue. Please submit your manuscripts in English, or in French, and feel free to forward this information to colleagues and students who may be interested. We look forward to your manuscripts and to the next issue of IJCAR. \nHappy reading! \nMartine Hébert, Editor-in-Chief",

        "abstract": "Study Background The effects of systemic racism were exacerbated and amplified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of the “Black Lives Matter” movement in North America brought awareness to the public, especially white people, of the impacts of systemic racism in society and the urgent need for large-scale and institutional anti-racism work. Purpose In collaboration with a local Community Health Centre, this research focused on identifying priority areas for tailored and co-developed anti-Black racism interventions in health services and community programming, as well as examining how purposeful relationships can be created with African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) communities in London, Ontario. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted in either French or English with nine formal or informal leaders from London's ACB communities. Interpretive description methodology guided analysis and interpretation. Results Participants indicated that anti-Black racism is ever-present in the community and in their lives, with systemic racism causing the most harm. Racism should be addressed by creating ACB-specific services, and education for non-Black communities; increased representation, inclusion, and engagement of ACB people within organizations, especially in leadership roles, are essential. A framework based on study findings to guide how organizations can develop authentic and purposeful relationships with ACB communities is presented. Conclusions Organizations will continue to perpetuate systemic racism unless they actively seek to be anti-racist and implement strategies and policies to this end. The proposed framework can guide partnerships between health and community organizations and ACB communities, and support co-development of strategies to address anti-Black racism.",

        "abstract": "Colour is a silent language with the help of which people can communicate. It is rich in hidden meanings and symbolisms. We think of colour as an independent concept with a part to play in every aspect of our lives. Colour, as we know, does not exist in the outside world, beyond us, like gravity, protons and oxygen do. Instead, colour is created inside our heads. It is the characteristic of human visual perception. The recognition and interpretation of colour are determined by numerous factors: cultural, religious, spiritual, physiological, and psychological. Colour terms are widely used in phraseological units. Among most common ones are the idioms with the two opposite spectra – colours black and white. The present article discusses the perception of black and white in English and Armenian idioms. The current research is an attempt aimed at revealing the similarities and differences in these two languages through comparative-contrastive and descriptive methods of analysis.",

This questionnaire-based pilot study explored student and staff expectations, in a large English widening participation university. In all, 65 students and 27 staff participated. Most notable was the similarity of student responses regardless of demographic characteristics. However, students already in paid work were significantly more likely to agree that they liked the university and found it easy to make friends. Students who might consider taking on paid work expressed significantly more concern that they may struggle with their academic work whilst those not in paid work had significantly more concerns about exams and self-directed learning. In terms of transferable academic skills, Black students were significantly less likely than white students to expect to make detailed class notes for themselves, albeit within this small sample size, while those first-in-family identified more academic skills needs than other student groups. Significantly more staff than students considered classroom attendance necessary. This pilot study suggests future research directions, including the impact of paid work and ethnicity on specific academic skills and underlines the importance of student support.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe dengue virus is a significant global public health concern that poses a threat to Africa. Particularly, African countries are at risk of viral introductions through air travel connectivity with areas of South America and Asia that experience frequent explosive outbreaks. Limited reporting and diagnostic capacity hinder a comprehensive assessment of continent-wide transmission dynamics and deployment of surveillance strategies in Africa.\n\nMethodsThe risk of dengue introduction into Africa from countries of high incidence was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows and epidemic activity at origin. We produced a novel proxy for local dengue epidemic activity using a composite index of theoretical climate-driven transmission potential and population density, which we used, along with travel information in a risk flow model, to estimate the importation risks.\n\nFindingsWe find that countries in east Africa face higher risk of importation from Asia, whereas for west African countries, larger risk of importation is estimated from South America. Some countries with high risk of importation experience low local transmission potential which likely hampers the chances that importations lead to local establishment and transmission. Conversely, Mauritius, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Kenya are identified as countries susceptible to dengue introductions during periods of persistent transmission suitability.\n\nInterpretationOur work improves the data driven allocation of surveillance resources, in regions of Africa that are at high risk of dengue introductions and establishment. This will be critical in detecting and managing imported cases and can improve local response to dengue outbreaks.\n\nFundingRockefeller Foundation, National Institute of Health, EDCTP3 and Horizon Europe Research and Innovation, World Bank Group, Medical Research Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Google.org, Oxford Martin School Pandemic Genomics programme, John Fell Fund\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDespite the significant global burden of dengue virus globally, Africa remains relatively understudied due to limited reporting and diagnostic capabilities. We searched PubMed for articles in English published on and before May 6, 2024, that included \"Dengue OR dengue\", \"Africa\", and \"importation OR imported\". Few studies have investigated the introduction of dengue into African countries. Limited evidence includes phylogeographic studies describing a potential introduction of dengue from Brazil into Angola in 2013 and evidence of multiple historical introductions of dengue from Asia to Africa over several years. Before our study, none had employed a modelling framework to investigate the continental risks of importing dengue via viremic travellers into African countries from other regions of high dengue incidence.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study provides a novel approach to assessing the risk of dengue importation into Africa, integrating temperature-dependent transmission potential and air travel data. By identifying high-risk regions and highlighting the complex interplay between travel patterns, population density, and ecological factors, our findings enhance the understanding of dengue dynamics in Africa. This information enables targeted allocation of surveillance resources, improving preparedness and response to potential dengue outbreaks in susceptible regions.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe integration of transmission potential as local epidemic activity and air travel data into a risk flow metric provides valuable insights into the risk of dengue importation into African airports from high-incidence countries. These findings have implications for tailored surveillance and prevention strategies in high-risk regions, facilitating early detection and management of potential dengue imported cases outbreaks in Africa.",

        "abstract": "Country music has become commercially successful both in the US and worldwide. It is perceived as a genre that values authenticity, which may be reflected in the choice of linguistic features, with (White) Southern American English (SAE) serving as the “default” variety. Given the recent diversification of the genre, the question arises whether the use of SAE features is still considered obligatory as a kind of “supralocal norm”. This study compared the lyrics of 600 highly successful songs by male and female artists from White Southern, Black Southern, and White non-Southern backgrounds. The aim was to test (i) whether morphosyntactic SAE features are used to index authenticity in the sense of having become enregistered for this music genre and (ii) whether non-Southerners engage in the styling of relevant markers. It emerged that non-Southerners use more of these features than their Southern counterparts, providing preliminary evidence for “genre fitting” as a means of indexing authenticity. However, there is only one marker that qualifies as a core Country feature used across all artist groups, namely negative concord. As this item arguably is better categorized as vernacular universal, SAE morphosyntax appears to have largely lost its indexical function in Country, while accent features are still vital to establishing cultural authenticity.",

        "abstract": "Background The most effective injective treatment approach for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain remains unclear. Aim of this study was to quantify the safety and effectiveness of the available injective strategies to address SIJ pain. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception until January 2023. Inclusion criteria were studies written in English, comparative and non-comparative studies regardless of the minimum follow-up, and case series on SIJ injections. Safety and efficacy of the different injection therapies for the SIJ were quantified. A meta-analysis was conducted on the available data of the documented injective therapies. The “Checklist for Measuring Quality” by Downs and Black was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of papers. Results The literature search retrieved 43 papers (2431 patients): 16 retrospective case series, 2 retrospective comparative studies, 17 prospective case series, 3 prospective comparative studies, and 5 randomized controlled trials. Of the selected studies, 63% examined the effect of steroid injections, 16% of PRP injections, while 21% reported other heterogeneous treatments. The failure rate was 26% in steroid injections and 14% in PRP injections. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in pain with the VAS score for both steroids and PRP: steroids improvement at mid-term 3.4 points (p < 0.05), at long-term 3.0 (p < 0.05), PRP improvement at mid-term 2.2 (p = 0.007), at long-term 2.3 points of the VAS pain scale (p = 0.02). Conclusions Steroids are the most documented injective approach, with studies showing an overall safety and effectiveness. Still, the high number of failures underlined by some studies suggest the need for alternative procedures. Early PRP data showed promise, but the limitations of the current literature do not allow to clearly define the most suitable injective approach, and further studies are needed to identify the best injective treatment for SIJ patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the current level of seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance in England and establish the evolving socio-demographic determinants of seasonal influenza uptake and intent-to-vaccinate behaviours between 2020 and 2022. To provide a framework for predicting future rates of seasonal influenza uptake at sub-national scales in England. Design: Two cross-sectional online surveys analysed using a Bayesian time-series multilevel model followed by poststratification to re-weight against English census data. Setting: England, September 2020 to July 2022. Participants: 28,748 English adults, 18 years of age and older. Main outcome measures Three response variables: whether an individual was offered a seasonal influenza vaccine on the NHS in the last 12 months, whether this offer was accepted, and whether they would accept a seasonal influenza vaccine in the next 12 months. Results: In the 2021-22 flu season, 56.3% of adults in England were offered the seasonal influenza vaccine, marking a significant increase of 10.7 percentage points compared to the 2019-20 season. Notably, acceptance of the seasonal influenza vaccine saw a marked rise during this period, par- ticularly among individuals aged 50 and over. However, intentions to accept the vaccine in the next 12 months showed a slight decline across the entire adult population between 2020 and 2022 surveys, although there was an increase among individuals aged 65 and over. Socio-demographic traits play a significant role in shaping vaccine behaviours, with age, gender, education, ethnicity, and religion influencing the likelihood of being offered the vaccine, accepting it when offered, and intending to receive future vaccinations. Noteworthy differences were observed across demographic groups, with smaller gaps among individuals aged 65 and over, particularly between Black/Black British and White respondents. Of particular concern is waning intent-to-accept behaviours among Asian and Asian British groups, as well as Hindus and Punjabi speakers. Regional disparities also emerged, with estimates for flu vaccine receipt and future intent being lowest in London, especially inner London. Moreover, forecasts generated from 2022 data regarding future flu vaccine uptake correlated well with the observed UK Health Security Agency-reported uptake in the subsequent 2022-23 flu season. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant progress made in increasing seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among adults in England during the 2021-22 flu season, particularly among the older population. However, despite these improvements, disparities persist across socio-demographic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address barriers to vaccine acceptance. The slight decline in intention to accept the vaccine in the next 12 months among the general adult population warrants attention and suggests the importance of ongoing efforts to promote vaccine confidence and accessibility. Furthermore, the regional disparities observed emphasize the importance of tailoring vaccination strategies to address specific geographical contexts. The strong correlation between predicted vaccine uptake and observed data indicates the potential utility of pre- dictive modelling in informing public health interventions. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and public health practitioners to enhance influenza vaccination efforts and mitigate the burden of influenza-related illness in England.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children, yet parental hesitancy towards vaccinating children against the virus persists. We conducted a telephone-administered weighted survey in Texas to examine parents’ sociodemographic factors and medical conditions associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention for parents with unvaccinated children ages 5–17 years. We collected responses from 19,502 participants, of which 4879 were parents of children ages 5–17 years. We conducted multiple logistic regression with Lasso-selected variables to identify factors associated with children’s vaccination status and parents’ intention to vaccinate their children. From the unweighted sample, less than half of the parents (46.8%) had at least one unvaccinated child. These parents were more likely to be White, English-speaking, not concerned about illness, privately insured, and unvaccinated for COVID-19 themselves (p < 0.001). In the adjusted regression model, parents who were unvaccinated (vs. having COVID-19 booster, aOR = 28.6) and financially insecure (aOR = 1.46) had higher odds of having unvaccinated children. Parents who were Asian (aOR = 0.50), Black (aOR = 0.69), Spanish-speaking (aOR = 0.57), concerned about illness (aOR = 0.63), had heart disease (aOR = 0.41), and diabetes (aOR = 0.61) had lower odds of having unvaccinated children. Parents who were Asian, Black, Hispanic, Spanish-speaking, concerned about illness for others, and vaccine-boosted were more likely to have vaccination intention for their children (p < 0.001). Children’s vaccination is essential to reduce COVID-19 transmission. It is important to raise awareness about the value of pediatric COVID-19 vaccination while considering parents’ sociodemographic and medical circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Aims Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (R-UKA) has been proposed as an approach to improve the results of the conventional manual UKA (C-UKA). The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyze the studies comparing R-UKA and C-UKA in terms of clinical outcomes, radiological results, operating time, complications, and revisions. Methods The literature search was conducted on three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science) on 20 February 2024 according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Inclusion criteria were comparative studies, written in the English language, with no time limitations, on the comparison of R-UKA and C-UKA. The quality of each article was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist for Measuring Quality. Results Among the 3,669 articles retrieved, 21 studies on 19 series of patients were included. A total of 3,074 patients (59.5% female and 40.5% male; mean age 65.2 years (SD 3.9); mean BMI 27.4 kg/m2 (SD 2.2)) were analyzed. R-UKA obtained a superior Knee Society Score improvement compared to C-UKA (mean difference (MD) 4.9; p < 0.001) and better Forgotten Joint Score postoperative values (MD 5.5; p = 0.032). The analysis of radiological outcomes did not find a statistically significant difference between the two approaches. R-UKA showed longer operating time (MD 15.6; p < 0.001), but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA (5.2% vs 10.1% and 4.1% vs 7.2%, respectively). Conclusion This meta-analysis showed that the robotic approach for UKA provided a significant improvement in functional outcomes compared to the conventional manual technique. R-UKA showed similar radiological results and longer operating time, but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA. Overall, R-UKA seems to provide relevant benefits over C-UKA in the management of patients undergoing UKA. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2024;5(5):374–384.",

Findings This cohort study of 366 871 patients found that patients with hypertension who are Black or Hispanic, who are uninsured, whose preferred language is not English, and who smoke are less likely to engage with patient portals. Meaning These findings suggest that as health care systems use patient portals more frequently for hypertension-related interventions and programs, disadvantaged patient groups are being left behind, potentially exacerbating existing disparities in blood pressure control.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To collect and document the numerous barriers that people living with hepatitis B (PLHB) encounter when trying to access their hepatitis B virus (HBV) medications. Design Researchers collected qualitative data through 24 online interviews. The semistructured interview questions focused on the impact that HBV has on different aspects of daily life (physical, emotional and social), personal experiences managing their infection, HBV treatment experiences and interactions with healthcare providers. Setting All interviews occurred over Zoom. Participants The participant cohort consisted of 12 males and 12 females. 63% of all participants represented communities of colour (37% white, 17% black/African/African American and 46% Asian/Asian American). Most of the participants were on antiviral treatment at the time of the study (62%). Participants were PLHB (self-reported), ≥18 years old, living in the USA or Canada and spoke English. Results Participants reported several barriers to accessing medicine among PLHB including financial barriers, health insurance and pharmacy preauthorisation process and other intangible barriers like lack of access to reliable patient-friendly information and stigma. The identified barriers to accessing HBV medication impacted patients’ continuity of care. Conclusions Access to medicine is essential to improving health outcomes. PLHB experience significant barriers to accessing HBV antivirals at different levels. Patient-related, physician-related and healthcare system barriers were identified as themes contributing to antiviral access challenges. More research is needed to identify strategies to improve access to HBV medications.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the experiences and perceptions of COVID-19 contact-tracing efforts among cases tested in under-resourced and predominately Latino and Black communities of South Los Angeles, California. Methods: Study involved a cross-sectional survey with 1,713 adults. Recruitment occurred between June and November 2021 with eligible individuals who had previously received a COVID-19 diagnosis through designated testing sites. The LA County Department of Public Health operated a culturally responsive program for contact tracing that included provision of education and service referrals to newly diagnosed cases through much of the pandemic. Results: Participants were majority female (63%), Hispanic/Latino/a/x (64%), ages 18–40 (69%), and surveyed in English (77%). Overall contact-tracing experiences were rated positively, regardless of demographics (average means of 3.1–3.2/4.0). Those surveyed in Spanish were more likely to endorse positive statements if their contact tracer also spoke Spanish. Although over 75% of participants shared a range of the different information types requested, 49–52% endorsed concerns about data security and uses of the solicited information. Conclusions: Despite eliciting some concerns, contact-tracing efforts were generally positively received. Policy implications: Investments in contact tracing in similar communities should consider language-concordant contact tracers, community-based health worker training in trust building, and addressing social and health needs.",

        "abstract": "Pulses—comprising the dry, edible seeds of leguminous plants—have long been lauded for their culinary flexibility and substantial nutritional advantages. This scoping review aimed to map the evidence on how pulses contribute to overall human health. Four electronic databases were searched for clinical and observational studies in English. We identified 30 articles (3 cross-sectional studies, 1 federated meta-analysis, 8 prospective cohort studies, 1 before-and-after study, and 17 randomized controlled trials) that met our inclusion criteria. Predominant among the pulses studied were lentils, chickpeas, common bean varieties (e.g., pinto, black, navy, red, kidney), black-eyed peas, cowpeas, and split peas. Consumption modalities varied; most studies examined mixed pulses, while five isolated individual types. In intervention studies, pulses were incorporated into diets by allotting a fixed pulse serving on top of a regular diet or by substituting red meat with pulses, offering a comparative analysis of dietary effects. The health outcomes evaluated were multifaceted, ranging from lipid profiles to blood pressure, cardiovascular disease risk and mortality, type 2 diabetes and glycemic control, metabolic syndrome indicators, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress biomarkers, and hormonal profiles. The most frequently assessed study outcomes included changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, waist circumference, and C-reactive protein or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This review should serve as a call to action for the scientific community to build upon the existing evidence, enriching our understanding of the nutritional and health-promoting attributes of pulses.",

        "abstract": "Objective To systematically map evidence to answer the research question: What is the relationship between the characteristics of children and young people (CYP) or their caregivers and primary care service use in the UK, taking into account underlying healthcare needs? Design Scoping review. Setting Primary care. Eligibility criteria English-language quantitative or mixed-methods studies published between 2012 and 2022. Data sources Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index, and grey literature. Results 22 eligible studies were identified, covering general practice (n=14), dental health (n=4), child mental health (MN) services (n=3) and immunisation (n=1). Only eight studies (36%) controlled for variables associated with healthcare need (eg, age, birth weight and long-term conditions). In these, evidence of horizontal inequity in primary care use was reported for CYP living in deprived areas in England, with and without complex needs. Horizontal inequity was also identified in primary care MN referrals for CYP in England identifying as mixed-race, Asian or black ethnicity, compared with their white British peers. No evidence of horizontal inequity was observed, however, in primary care use for CYP in England exposed to parental depression, or for CYP children from low-income households in Scotland. Increasing CYP’s age was associated with decreasing primary care use across included studies. No studies were found regarding CYP from Gypsy or Traveller communities, children in care, or those with disabilities or special educational needs. Conclusions There is evidence that socioeconomic factors impact on CYP’s primary care use, in particular age, ethnicity and deprivation. However, better quality evidence is required to evaluate horizontal inequity in use and address knowledge gaps regarding primary care use for vulnerable CYP populations and the impact of policy and practice related ‘supply side’ of primary care.",

The search used Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Science, EMBASE, Springer, and ProQuest. A quality assessment checklist developed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for the cross-sectional study was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the included papers. Inverse variance and Cochran Q statistics were employed in the STATA software version 14 to assess study heterogeneity. When there was heterogeneity, the Dersimonian and Liard random-effects models were used.\n \n \n \n 59 Studies totaling 87353 participants were included in this meta-analysis. These investigations included 86278 participants in 55 studies on knowledge, 20196 in 33 studies on attitudes, and 74881 in 29 studies on practices. The pooled estimates for sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and dengue fever preventive behaviors among the general population were determined as 40.1% (95% CI 33.8%-46.5%), 46.8% (95% CI 35.8%-58.9%), and 38.3% (95% CI 28.4%-48.2%), respectively. Europe exhibits the highest knowledge level at 63.5%, and Africa shows the lowest at 20.3%. Positive attitudes are most prevalent in the Eastern Mediterranean (54.1%) and Southeast Asia (53.6%), contrasting sharply with the Americas, where attitudes are notably lower at 9.05%. Regarding preventive behaviors, the Americas demonstrate a prevalence of 12.1%, Southeast Asia at 28.1%, Western Pacific at 49.6%, Eastern Mediterranean at 44.8%, and Africa at 47.4%.\n \n \n \n Regional disparities about the knowledge, attitude and preventive bahaviors are evident with Europe exhibiting the highest knowledge level while Africa has the lowest.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe COVID-19 pandemic transformed healthcare delivery with the rapid adoption of telehealth and digital technologies to access healthcare. Interventions are needed to ensure that older people in underserved communities do not face new technology-driven healthcare disparities. This article describes pioneering electronic medical record (EMR) embedded tools to assess and support each diverse patient's digital health literacy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe designed and validated a rapid EMR-embedded Digital Health Engagement Tool (DHET) to assess each patient's digital literacy in English and Spanish. We built a separate, EMR-generated auto-scoring function to assess patient use of telehealth and healthcare navigation as recorded within the EMR. Combined, the tools created a complete digital literacy assessment for each patient. We then deployed the tools to conduct a pilot study to elucidate disparities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 112 ethnic/racial diverse older patients were enrolled (mean age was 78, ranging from 57 to 96) years (SD = 8.04). The female participants were 72.3%. Among the participants, non-Hispanic Whites were 47.3%; Hispanic 25.0%; non-Hispanic Asian 19.6%; non-Hispanic others (including multi-race and non-Hispanic Black/African Americans) 8.0%. Digital literacy disparities were revealed for older adults, particularly those over 70 years old, female gender, and those reporting relying on a helper.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNew EMR-embedded tools enable healthcare systems to assess the ability of patients to navigate and utilize EMR capabilities, such as video telehealth appointments, messaging providers, reviewing labs/radiology reports, and requesting prescriptions. The study identified significant challenges for older patients in navigating EMRs and calls for healthcare systems to better support patient learning.",

        "abstract": "People from Nigeria were thrown to different corners of the world in the course of slavery. The dispersal curiously created financial enduring financial fortunes for European states and their people. Many of the slaves were assembled in today’s United States of America. The Europeans returned to force their way into the communities of the Africans in the name of colonialism. Great wealth transfer occurred, which continues to this day. What is usually not mentioned is the destruction of the local people’s cultures that took place. England stage-managed a war in Nigeria; a war designed to permanently plant English foot in Nigeria. Nigeria became the kitchen for crude oil to service English lifestyle and industries. The weight of English economic program in Nigeria is too much for the natives to bear. Nigeria is further reduced to a beggar colony. The outcome is also a hopeless citizenry seeking succour in England and other parts of the world. There are deficiencies noticed in all aspects of Nigerian life. Unfortunately, there is increasing defence among Nigerians of the role of England in the predicament of Nigeria, thus throwing open the debate on colonisation. This work identifies English roles in Nigeria’s and correctly lays the blame on the West, especially England. Popular assumptions by many British people that their country is not appreciated for civilizing the Nigerians is gaining support from the young people in Nigeria. The purpose of the essay is also to initiate a vigorous re-education of young people on the subject matter. The work is influenced by debates this writer followed on Facebook. Books, newspaper and journal articles are the sources of the materials used for this essay.",

        "abstract": "In Brazil and around the world, the problems resulting from urban planning, changes in land cover and the increase in urban infrastructure influence temperature change. The aim of this research is to understand the difference in temperature over the last 36 years (1985-2021) in the city of Cuiabá/MT, and its relationship with vegetation and socioeconomic and racial-ethnic factors. Annual images (36 images) from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites between 1985 and 2021 were used, and Google Earth Engine was used to obtain this data for the urban area of the city of Cuiabá. Mapping of the spatial distribution of surface temperature, vegetation and changes in land use and cover was carried out using data from the MapBiomas project and socio-economic data from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE, Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in English) 2010 census. The results indicated that over the last 36 years Cuiabá's surface temperature has increased by an average of 13°C, as part of the result of the growth of urban infrastructure and loss of vegetation cover, specifically in the peripheral areas. There is an inequality between the high-income population living in neighborhoods with milder temperatures and the low-income population living in neighborhoods with higher temperatures. In the temperature and skin color data, the white population generally lives in neighborhoods with milder temperatures, unlike the black population, which mostly suffers from high temperatures.",

        "abstract": "How are Asian and Black men and women stereotyped? Research from the gendered race and stereotype content perspectives has produced mixed empirical findings. Using BERT models pre-trained on English language books, news articles, Wikipedia, Reddit and Twitter, with a new method for measuring propositions in natural language (the Fill-Mask Association Test, FMAT), we explored the gender (masculinity-femininity), physical strength, warmth and competence contents of stereotypes about Asian and Black men and women. We find that Asian men (but not women) are stereotyped as less masculine and less moral/trustworthy than Black men. Compared to Black men and Black women, respectively, both Asian men and Asian women are stereotyped as less muscular/athletic and less assertive/dominant, but more sociable/friendly and more capable/intelligent. These findings suggest that Asian and Black stereotypes in natural language have multifaceted contents and gender nuances, requiring a balanced view integrating the gender schema theory and the stereotype content model. Exploring their semantic representations as propositions in large language models, this research reveals how intersectional race-gender stereotypes are naturally expressed in real life.",

        "abstract": "The vast majority of the popular English named entity recognition (NER) datasets contain American or British English data, despite the existence of many global varieties of English. As such, it is unclear whether they generalize for analyzing use of English globally. To test this, we build a newswire dataset, the Worldwide English NER Dataset, to analyze NER model performance on low-resource English variants from around the world. We test widely used NER toolkits and transformer models, including models using the pre-trained contextual models RoBERTa and ELECTRA, on three datasets: a commonly used British English newswire dataset, CoNLL 2003, a more American focused dataset OntoNotes, and our global dataset. All models trained on the CoNLL or OntoNotes datasets experienced significant performance drops-over 10 F1 in some cases-when tested on the Worldwide English dataset. Upon examination of region-specific errors, we observe the greatest performance drops for Oceania and Africa, while Asia and the Middle East had comparatively strong performance. Lastly, we find that a combined model trained on the Worldwide dataset and either CoNLL or OntoNotes lost only 1-2 F1 on both test sets.",

Our purpose was to systematically review the literature about Kinesiophobia in athletes. A systematic review was conducted in February 2023 using PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Medline. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed, in English, within the last 20 years and included athletes who had been injured and tracked Kinesiophobia. Articles were checked for quality via the modified Downs and Black checklist. Fourteen studies were included in the review and had an average “fair” quality score. Authors examined Kinesiophobia in injured athletes with mostly lower-extremity injuries. Kinesiophobia was associated with lower physical and mental outcomes. Kinesiophobia exists in athletes and can affect both physical and mental factors. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was the most common tool used to examine Kinesiophobia. Common mental factors associated with Kinesiophobia include anxiety, low confidence, and fear avoidance.",

This essay offers five new English translations from his first collection Black Feathers (Svartar Fjaðrir,1919) and introduces a new decadent perspective. Decadence is widely regarded as flourishing in emergent modern societies, but, as this essay shows, its influence extended beyond western Europe. Written in a remote place, Stefánsson’s decadence speaks to an aesthetic of emptiness and atemporality. These poems broaden our conception of decadence and evidence a rich cultural hybridity, showing the influence of various traditions including symbolism, the Gothic, folk-songs, and decadence.",

        "abstract": "The recent African scramble has resulted in uneven and combined development (UCD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) throughout the 21st century due to unequal exchange. South Africa plays a sub-imperial role in this scramble in SSA. It both exploits and is exploited. The mining industry in South Africa has attracted interest from colonial powers, English-speaking businesses, and foreign investors, making it a highly lucrative sector. Furthermore, most black South Africans have been employed in the mining industry since the late 19th century. Over the past 25 years, the African National Congress government has utilised the mining industry to achieve economic transformation through black economic empowerment policies. This study proposes that the mining sector in South Africa is responsible for the ongoing UCD, despite receiving new investments and empowerment policies. South Africa’s inclusion in BRICS has broadened its range of international partners beyond its traditional Western or African counterparts. However, South Africa’s decision to join the BRICS group in 2011 has not yet yielded the expected transformation in the country’s economy and growth. As a result, it is uncertain whether South Africa’s BRICS membership has addressed the country’s persistent problem of UCD. This study argues that South Africa’s BRICS membership has exacerbated UCD in the country. This study proposes that Trotsky’s UCD analytical framework is useful for analysing South Africa’s policy choice to join BRICS, which strengthens its sub-imperial role.",

A critical approach was taken to understand how issues of power such as race and socio-economic status, combined with the parents own African culture, affected their interactions with education professionals who hold an entirely different contextual disposition. The parents took part in semi-structured interviews which were thematically analysed. Three overarching themes were identified: Communication (which focused on issues such as language, articulation and communication styles ); cultural barriers (which encompassed the cultural differences between the parents and the education professionals) ; and the parent-professional relationship (which was key for the parents to navigate the SEND system). Recommendations for practice such as professionals building more trust with parents, engaging more with cultural competency training and evaluating the accessibility of their current services are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Whereas the burden of burn injury is greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), publications from these regions represent a disproportionately small volume of the published burn literature in English. This important gap in our cumulative knowledge contributes to the slow progress in global burn injury control. In addition to manuscripts, clinical photographs are important representations of injury and outcomes. We aimed to compare the current volume of burn publications and photographs to the global burn injury burden and sought to identify potential journal-level barriers to publication. Methods A bibliometric analysis was performed by sampling three leading burn surgery journals published in the English language (Journal of Burn Care and Research, Burns, European Burn Journal) between 2021-2023. Country of corresponding author and number of photos were tabulated and categorized by region. Volume was compared to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 estimates for incidence of thermal injury by region. Journal submission instructions were reviewed for potential barriers to publication. Results A total of 916 articles were reviewed from 59 countries. Analysis showed 147 articles with 1117 human photos. GBD incidence of burn, publications, and photographs by region are shown in Figure 1. North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania had a higher proportion of published images to burn injury incidence than Latin America, Africa, and Asia (X2 (6, N = 915) =3585, p < 0.001). Barriers to journal publication included charges for published images (up to 600 USD/image), open access costs (900-3500 USD with 1 of 3 publishers offering tiered discounts specific to LMIC), English language review (0.06-0.07 USD/word), and society affiliation discounts. Table 1 summarizes identified barriers and potential solutions. Conclusions There is a relative paucity of LMIC contributions to publications and clinical photos in English language burn journals. Identified publication barriers and added costs from journals likely contribute to this disparity. Applicability of Research to Practice Publication-level strategies to increase authorship and clinical photographs from underrepresented regions are urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "\nThrough the later seventeenth century, Protestant missions in English America were surrounded by controversy. Missionaries working with Amerindians and enslaved Africans were accused of threatening the stability of overseas dominions. Crown officials were alleged to have impeded evangelism, and colluded in a culture of colonial godlessness. In modern scholarship, these conflicts have been located within a context of long-term tension between “religion” and “empire.” This article suggests that they were rooted in the transatlantic divisions within English Protestantism, and in political conditions peculiar to the 1660 Restoration. Colonial missions developed competitively and acrimoniously, when the Church of England vied against Protestant rivals in America, and when ecclesiastical policy in England remained unsettled. Battles for converts between Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists stirred disputes over the management of England’s multi-confessional dominions. Simultaneously, they raised questions over how a colonizing kingdom could export the reformed religion, when its own confessional environment was severely divided.",

        "abstract": "Background Sexual assault occurring within healthcare settings represents a significant breach of public trust. This scoping review aimed to highlight the profile of people raped, those who committed the rape within the health facilities, and the legal actions taken to resolved cases. Methods Media-reported data on incidents of rape in healthcare settings were collected. The search was conducted in May and June 2023, focusing on English-language publications with accessible full texts. Reports that lacked information on the survivors or incidents that occurred outside of healthcare settings were excluded. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the categories of the collected publications, and graphical representations were employed for visualization purposes. Results A total of 62 cases were retrieved, originating from Africa ( n  = 17; 27.4%), Europe ( n  = 14; 22.6%), Southeast Asia ( n  = 14; 22.6%), the Americas ( n  = 11; 17.7%), the Western Pacific Region ( n  = 5; 8.1%) and Eastern Mediterranean region ( n  = 1; 1.6%). In addition, 69 individuals were implicated in 59 cases. They were 31 doctors (44.9%), 17 (24.6%) nurses, four (5.8%) nurse/healthcare assistants, three (4.3%) cleaners/ward boy, two (2.9%) traditional medical doctors, and two (2.9%) security guards. Others included six (8.7%) staff members without designations and one (1.4%) ambulance driver. All perpetrators were male, ranging in age from 22 to 67 years. There were 66 victims identified in the 62 cases with age ranging from 2 to 92 years. Except for one case, all victims were female, and all but one case were patients. Most assaults occurred in consulting rooms/clinics ( n  = 21; 31.8%), 16 (24.2%) happened under sedation, and six (9.1%) were repeatedly raped, Survivors typically reported the cases the police ( n  = 12; 19.4%), family/friends ( n  = 11; 17.7%) or to hospital authorities ( n  = 10; 16.1%). Out of the 69 perpetrators, 19 (30.6%) were imprisoned with sentences ranging from 12 months to an indefinite period and one (1.6%) received a death sentence. Conclusion The raping of patients by healthcare providers within healthcare settings calls for urgent and extensive measures. Stakeholders in healthcare management need to prioritize raising awareness about the problem, implement robust prevention and reporting strategies, and create healthcare environments that are safe, respectful, and supportive for all individuals seeking care.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Patient portals allowing access to electronic health care records and services can inform and empower, but may widen existing sociodemographic inequities. We aimed to describe associations between activation of a paediatric patient portal and patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and markers of previous engagement with health care. Methods A retrospective single site cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine patient portal adoption amongst families of children receiving care for chronic or complex disorders within the United Kingdom. Descriptive and multivariable regression analysis was undertaken to describe associations between predictors (Race/Ethnicity, age, socio-economic deprivation status based on family residence, and previous non-attendance to outpatient consultations) and outcome. Results A sample of 3687 children, representative of the diverse real world patient population, was identified. Of these 37% (1364) were from a White British background, 71% (2631) had English as the primary family spoken language (PSL), 14% (532) lived in areas of high deprivation, and 17% (643) had high (>33%) rates of non-attendance. The families of 73% (2682) had activated the portal. In adjusted analyses, English as a PSL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.66-2.36) was positively associated with portal activation, whilst families from British Black African backgrounds (aOR 0.58, 0.44-0.77), those living in areas of deprivation (aOR 0.81, 0.67-0.98) or with high rates of non-attendance (aOR 0.32, 0.27-0.39) were less likely to use the portal. Conclusions Socio-economic deprivation, race/ethnicity and previous low engagement with health care services are potentially key drivers of widening inequity in access to health care following the implementation of patient portals, a digital health innovation intended to inform and empower patients. Health care providers should be aware that innovative human-driven engagement approaches, targeted towards under-served communities, are needed to ensure equitable access to high quality patient-centred care.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To address a gap in radiation oncology education in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), we sought to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of a refined curriculum on intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) offered to existing radiation therapy (RT) clinics across Africa and Latin America (LATAM) at no cost. Methods A curriculum was created based on prior needs assessments and adapted for participating medical physicists, radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, and trainees in LMICs. English-speaking and Spanish-speaking teams of volunteer educators delivered 27 hour-long sessions 1–2 times weekly for 4 months using video conferencing to African and LATAM cohorts, respectively. Pre- and post-course multiple-choice examinations were administered to LATAM participants, and pre- and post-course self-confidence (1–5 Likert-scale) and open-ended feedback were collected from all participants. Results Twenty-five centers across Africa (13) and LATAM (12) participated, yielding a total of 332 enrolled participants (128 African, 204 LATAM). Sessions were delivered with a mean of 44 (22.5) and 85 (25.4) participants in the African and LATAM programs, respectively. Paired pre and post-course data demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) improvement in knowledge from 47.9 to 89.6% and self-confidence across four domains including foundations (+ 1.1), commissioning (+ 1.3), contouring (+ 1.7), and treatment planning (+ 1.0). Attendance was a significant predictor of change in self-confidence in “high attendance” participants only, suggesting a threshold effect. Qualitative data demonstrates that participants look forward to applying their knowledge in the clinical setting. Conclusion A specialized radiation oncology curriculum adapted for LMIC audiences was effective for both African and LATAM participants. Participant feedback suggests that the refined IMRT course empowered clinics with knowledge and confidence to help train others. This feasible “Hub and Spokes” approach in which a distance-learning course establishes a hub to be leveraged by spokes (learners) may be generalizable to others aiming to reduce global health care disparities through training efforts.",

        "title": "Sexual and reproductive health among forcibly displaced persons in urban environments in low and middle-income countries: scoping review findings",
        "abstract": "Background Most forcibly displaced persons are hosted in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). There is a growing urbanization of forcibly displaced persons, whereby most refugees and nearly half of internally displaced persons live in urban areas. This scoping review assesses the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs, outcomes, and priorities among forcibly displaced persons living in urban LMIC. Methods Following The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology we searched eight databases for literature published between 1998 and 2023 on SRH needs among urban refugees in LMIC. SHR was operationalized as any dimension of sexual health (comprehensive sexuality education [CSE]; sexual and gender based violence [GBV]; HIV and STI prevention and control; sexual function and psychosexual counseling) and/or reproductive health (antental, intrapartum, and postnatal care; contraception; fertility care; safe abortion care). Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature studies across quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods designs. Findings The review included 92 studies spanning 100 countries: 55 peer-reviewed publications and 37 grey literature reports. Most peer-reviewed articles (n = 38) discussed sexual health domains including: GBV (n = 23); HIV/STI (n = 19); and CSE (n = 12). Over one-third (n = 20) discussed reproductive health, including: antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care (n = 13); contraception (n = 13); fertility (n = 1); and safe abortion (n = 1). Eight included both reproductive and sexual health. Most grey literature (n = 29) examined GBV vulnerabilities. Themes across studies revealed social-ecological barriers to realizing optimal SRH and accessing SRH services, including factors spanning structural (e.g., livelihood loss), health institution (e.g., lack of health insurance), community (e.g., reduced social support), interpersonal (e.g., gender inequitable relationships), and intrapersonal (e.g., low literacy) levels. Conclusions This review identified displacement processes, resource insecurities, and multiple forms of stigma as factors contributing to poor SRH outcomes, as well as producing SRH access barriers for forcibly displaced individuals in urban LMIC. Findings have implications for mobilizing innovative approaches such as self-care strategies for SRH (e.g., HIV self-testing) to address these gaps. Regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean are underrepresented in research in this review. Our findings can guide SRH providers, policymakers, and researchers to develop programming to address the diverse SRH needs of urban forcibly displaced persons in LMIC. Plain English summary Most forcibly displaced individuals live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a significant number residing in urban areas. This scoping review examines the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes of forcibly displaced individuals in urban LMICs. We searched eight databases for relevant literature published between 1998 and 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. SRH was defined to include various dimensions of sexual health (comprehensive sexuality education; sexual and gender-based violence; HIV/ STI prevention; sexual function, and psychosexual counseling) and reproductive health (antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care; contraception; fertility care; and safe abortion care). We included 90 documents (53 peer-reviewed articles, 37 grey literature reports) spanning 100 countries. Most peer-reviewed articles addressed sexual health and approximately one-third centered reproductive health. The grey literature primarily explored sexual and gender-based violence vulnerabilities. Identified SRH barriers encompassed challenges across structural (livelihood loss), health institution (lack of insurance), community (reduced social support), interpersonal (gender inequities), and individual (low literacy) levels. Findings underscore gaps in addressing SRH needs among urban refugees in LMICs specifically regarding sexual function, fertility care, and safe abortion, as well as regional knowledge gaps regarding urban refugees in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Self-care strategies for SRH (e.g., HIV self-testing, long-acting self-injectable contraception, abortion self-management) hold significant promise to address SRH barriers experienced by urban refugees and warrant further exploration with this population. Urgent research efforts are necessary to bridge these knowledge gaps and develop tailored interventions aimed at supporting urban refugees in LMICs.

        "abstract": "Recent research in social psychology underscores the role of language and its intersection with other identity markers, including ethnic visibility, in exploring social perceptions and biases. This paper examines the physical visibility of people of Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) descent in the U.S., and the linguistic visibility of a concentrated MENA American community in Dearborn, Michigan. Relying on headshots, Study 1 shows that MENA could be an ambiguous ethnic community based solely on physical appearance, while religiously affiliated attire proves to be a significant ethnic marker for MENA. Using audio cues, Study 2 shows that the English variety spoken in Dearborn is a recognizable variety with masculinity associations. As such, Dearborn English is argued to be an ethnolinguistic repertoire that can be used to project ethno-local visibility. The results highlight the importance of the linguistic visibility of Dearborn and future research on language attitudes towards this variety.",

        "abstract": "The 15-item Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) is a widely used psychometric measure with evidence generally supporting its reliability and validity. However, limitations related to its ordinal response format and lack of cross-cultural comparisons have yet to be investigated using appropriate methods. The Partial Credit Rasch model was used to evaluate and enhance the psychometric properties of the DTS using responses from 2550 adult participants from the United States of America (USA), England, Canada, South Africa, Spain, and Argentina. The initial poor fit of the DTS to the Rasch model was improved by removing one item and combining locally dependent items into three testlets. These modifications resulted in the best fit of the 14-item DTS to the Rasch model for all the countries in our study, providing evidence of unidimensionality, high reliability and invariance across countries, meditation practice, and gender. Meeting the expectations of the Rasch model permitted the development of ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithms derived from person estimates of the Rasch model. Using the ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithms published in this article, ordinal DTS scores can be transformed into interval-level data, enhancing the precision of this scale for future research and clinical use across people from the six countries in this study and across the English and Spanish versions of the 14-item DTS.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of online learning platforms for facilitating knowledge translation in allied health professionals.\nMethodology: A systematic review of the literature searched three databases (Medline-OVID, CINAHL, Embase) in November 2023 for studies measuring outcomes of knowledge translation initiatives targeting allied health professionals delivered using online learning platforms. Papers were eligible if allied health professionals made up at least 50% of the sample, most of the learning component was online, and comparative data was reported. Data were extracted using a customised form. Quality of studies was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist. Meta-analyses were conducted where sufficient homogenous data were available.\nFindings: Twenty-three studies published over a 13-year period were included in this review primarily using pre-post study designs. All reported improvements in either knowledge, skill and/or confidence, with an meta-analysis (n=9 studies) showing a significant increase in knowledge gain after exposure to online learning (SMD 1.39; 95% CI = 0.96-1.83). However, there is little evidence that participation in online learning is associated with a change in clinical practice.\nResearch Implications: This study supports previous research that online learning can improve knowledge but highlights a need for more rigorous studies addressing the impacts on behaviour change.\nPractical Implications: Online learning is an effective way of improving knowledge, skill and/or confidence but additional knowledge translation strategies may be needed to lead to a behaviour change.\nOriginality/Value: Synthesis of current knowledge of the value and limitations of online learning as a tool to facilitate the implementation of evidence into practice in the allied health professions.\nLimitations: This review was limited to studies published in the English language only.  The quality of studies in this field is low. Few studies measure behaviour change.",

        "abstract": "The world-famous Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki (1949-) has been said to write universally-legible, made-to-be-translated fiction that is designed to circulate through the channels of global cultural commerce unimpeded by the thorny particularities of local specificity.  But this article explores a different side of Murakami—a side that attuned to the untranslatable particularity of socially contextualized language as he heard it spoken around him during his time living in the United States in the early 1990s.  Drawing on the scholar of comparative literature Michael Lucey’s approach to reading “the ethnography of talk,” the analysis focuses on how Murakami reconstructs a conversation about jazz that he had with a Black American interlocutor in New Jersey in the short essay “The Road Home From Berkeley” (Bākurē kara no kaerimichi), which appears in his volume of essays about living in the United States titled The Sadness of Foreign Language (Yagate kanashiki gaikokugo, 1994).  As the article compares the styles of speaking documented in “The Road Home From Berkeley” with those that appear in the English- and Japanese-language versions of Miles Davis’s autobiography Miles (which Murakami discusses in “The Road Home From Berkeley”) and J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (which Murakami translated himself), it reveals how Murakami has reflected on the specter of the untranslatable that haunts the global circulations of literature and pop culture.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent socio-demographic shifts in the United States have underscored the growing importance of informal caregiving and raised concerns about caregivers’ health and well-being. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the health dimensions of caregivers, considering their diverse backgrounds. Objective: To examine five key health dimensions (physical, cognitive, mental, social, and sexual health) of caregivers, and to identify potential disparities based on ethnoracial and linguistic differences. Methods: Using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), this study explores the interconnections among the specified health dimensions of caregivers and their ethnoracial (Black, Hispanic, White, and others) and linguistic (Spanish, English) backgrounds, in addition to their social networks (N=1,309). Regression analysis was employed to discern the patterns and associations. Results: The findings indicate that White caregivers generally report better physical, cognitive, and social health compared to their Black and Hispanic counterparts, but exhibit less favorable outcomes in sexual health than Hispanic caregivers. Spanish-speaking caregivers, while having lower cognitive and self-rated mental health than English-speaking caregivers, show stronger social health and greater relationship satisfaction. Notably, these correlations persist irrespective of the size of social networks, pointing to intrinsic links with health outcomes. Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of a comprehensive health evaluation for caregivers, acknowledging the intricate interplay between their health and various socio-demographic factors. It advocates for the development of targeted policies and interventions that address the complex health needs of caregivers, with an emphasis on their ethnoracial and linguistic contexts and social environments.",

        "title": "Linkage to HIV care and early retention in HIV care among men in the ‘universal test-and-treat’ era in a high HIV-burdened district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",
        "abstract": "Introduction Despite the numerous efforts and initiatives, males with HIV are still less likely than women to receive HIV treatment. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, men are tested, linked, and retained in HIV care at lower rates than women, and South Africa is no exception. This is despite the introduction of the universal test-and-treat (UTT) prevention strategy anticipated to improve the uptake of HIV services. The aim of this study was to investigate linkage to and retention in care rates of an HIV-positive cohort of men in a high HIV prevalence rural district in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods From January 2018 to July 2019, we conducted an observational cohort study in 18 primary health care institutions in the uThukela district. Patient-level survey and clinical data were collected at baseline, 4-months and 12-months, using isiZulu and English REDCap-based questionnaires. We verified data through TIER.Net, Rapid mortality survey (RMS), and the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) databases. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15.1, with confidence intervals and p-value of ≤0.05 considered statistically significant. Results The study sample consisted of 343 male participants diagnosed with HIV and who reside in uThukela District. The median age was 33 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29–40), and more than half (56%; n = 193) were aged 18–34 years. Almost all participants (99.7%; n = 342) were Black African, with 84.5% (n = 290) being in a romantic relationship. The majority of participants (85%; n = 292) were linked to care within three months of follow-up. Short-term retention in care (≤ 12 months) was 46% (n = 132) among men who were linked to care within three months. Conclusion While the implementation of the UTT strategy has had positive influence on improving linkage to care, men’s access of HIV treatment remains inconsistent and may require additional innovative strategies.",

        "title": "Suicidality during treatment with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors",
        "abstract": "Introduction Treatment choice when prescribing antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) is often influenced by safety and tolerability profiles. A transient increase in suicidality following antidepressant treatment initiation is a key concern. Although rare, its unpredictability and consequences make them a significant worry. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a “black-box” warning regarding a potential increase in suicidality in adolescents receiving antidepressant treatment for depression that was later expanded to include both young adults and a broader range of antidepressants. Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of increased suicidality during the treatment with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in young adults with MDD. Methods We conducted a non-systematic literature search on PubMed using the combination of MeSH terms ([Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors] OR [Levomilnacipran] OR [Desvenlafaxine Succinate] OR [Venlafaxine Hydrochloride] OR [Duloxetine Hydrochloride]) AND [Suicide] AND [Young Adult], and the keywords [(“Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors” OR “Levomilnacipran” OR “Desvenlafaxine” OR “Venlafaxine” OR “Duloxetine”) AND (“Suicide” OR “treatment-emergent suicidal ideation”) AND (“Young” OR “Youth”)]. Results A total of 31 manuscripts were retrieved and 6 were selected, 3 original research and 3 non-systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials. Only studies written in English that provided information about suicidality with SNRIs in young adults with MDD. Globally, studies show that not only antidepressants decrease the risk of suicide attempt in depressed patients, but also there is no evidence of an increased suicidality in young adults treated with SNRIs. Interestingly, one study showed that increasing suicidality could be related to side effects of the treatment, such as anxiety, agitation and irritability. The authors found that poor antidepressant response and greater severity of depression during follow-up were associated with treatment increasing suicidal ideation, as it was suggested in another study. Another study reinforced that there may be an emotional component to the activating effects produced by some antidepressants that could explain their controversial association with rare cases of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Conclusions In conclusion, growing evidence shows that antidepressants overall decrease the risk of suicide attempt in depressed patients. Therefore, reducing antidepressant use over the FDA concerns about increased suicidal tendencies in young patients may actually increase suicide risks due to inadequate treatment of depression. Additional studies are essential to further confirm the importance of early treatment for depression. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

        "title": "Understanding lived experiences and perceptions of resilience in black and South Asian Muslim children living in East London: a qualitative study protocol",
        "abstract": "Introduction It is important to promote resilience in preadolescence; however, there is limited research on children’s understandings and experiences of resilience. Quantitative approaches may not capture dynamic and context-specific aspects of resilience. Resilience research has historically focused on white, middle-class Western adults and adolescents, creating an evidence gap regarding diverse experiences of resilience in middle childhood which could inform interventions. East London’s Muslim community represents a diverse, growing population. Despite being disproportionately affected by deprivation and racial and cultural discrimination, this population is under-represented in resilience research. Using participatory and arts-based methods, this study aims to explore lived experiences and perceptions of resilience in black and South Asian Muslim children living in East London. Methods and analysis We propose a qualitative study, grounded in embodied inquiry, consisting of a participatory workshop with 6–12 children and their parents/carers to explore lived experiences and perceptions of resilience. Participants will be identified and recruited from community settings in East London. Eligible participants will be English-speaking Muslims who identify as being black or South Asian, have a child aged 8–12 years and live in East London. The workshop (approx. 3.5 hours) will take place at an Islamic community centre and will include body mapping with children and a focus group discussion with parents/carers to explore resilience perspectives and meanings. Participants will also complete a demographic survey. Workshop audio recordings will be transcribed verbatim and body maps and other paper-based activities will be photographed. Data will be analysed using systematic visuo-textual analysis which affords equal importance to visual and textual data. Ethics and dissemination The Queen Mary Ethics of Research Committee at Queen Mary University of London has approved this study (approval date: 9 October 2023; ref: QME23.0042). The researchers plan to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and present findings at academic conferences.",

        "abstract": "Evidence suggests an association between exposure to electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) marketing and e-cigarette use (vaping) among adolescents. However, there is limited evidence on exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, especially among Black and Latino adolescents. This study aimed to examine associations between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping among Black and Latino adolescents in the United States (US). Participants (N = 362; equal representation between Black and Latino adolescents) completed a baseline assessment (available in English and Spanish) including sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic group, age, gender, sexual orientation, etc.), exposure to e-cigarette marketing, and susceptibility to future vaping. Exposure to e-cigarette marketing was recoded and organized into two categories (high exposure = 2 to 3; low exposure = 0 to 1). Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests were used to evaluate the association between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, stratified by racial/ethnic group. Multiple logistic regressions assessed the association between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, controlling for gender, sexual orientation, grade, and academic performance within each racial/ethnic group. Black adolescents reported significantly higher frequencies of exposure to e-cigarette marketing (p = 0.005). A significant interaction was found between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and racial/ethnic group (X2 (1) = 6.294, p = 0.012). Among Black adolescents, high exposure to e-cigarette marketing (vs. low exposure) was associated with a higher probability of susceptibility to future vaping (OR: 2.399, 95% CI 1.147–5.021, p = 0.020). For Latino adolescents, exposure to e-cigarette marketing was not associated with susceptibility to future vaping (OR: 0.503, 95% CI 0.245–1.03, p = 0.062). Future studies should evaluate how and where adolescents are exposed to e-cigarette marketing. Prevention efforts must include the implementation of effective counter-marketing campaigns and the reduction of exposure to e-cigarette marketing among Black and Latino adolescents.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Despite food pantries’ efforts to improve nutritional quality and encourage healthy cooking, limited evidence exists regarding pantry shoppers’ culinary preferences and kitchen equipment access. This project utilized pantry food demonstrations and samples to collect recipe and kitchen tool feedback. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: For 4 months, a Culinary Medicine team delivered food demonstrations at Crossroads Community Services food market in Dallas, Texas, which serves primarily Hispanic and Black residents. Each demo provided a food sample, corresponding printed recipe in English or Spanish, and a survey. Part 1 of the survey measured shoppers’ hedonic liking of the sampled food and their likelihood of recreating it. Part 2 used the same scale for non-sampled recipes adapted from Health meets Food Community Culinary Medicine programming. Averages of appeal and likelihood to cook between sampled and unsampled groups were compared with a student’s T test. Part 3 contained a visual graphic of 24 kitchen appliances, and shoppers circled each item they owned. Investigators collected surveys from 207 shoppers across 12 demos. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Preliminary analyses showed a positive response to the food demonstrations with a mean rating on a 5-point Likert scale of 4.58 for recipe appeal and 4.46 for likelihood of cooking the recipe at home. The Health meets Food recipes not demonstrated were also positively reviewed (4.40 for appeal and 4.32 for likelihood to cook). There was a statistically significant difference in appeal between sampled and non-sampled recipes (p = 0.03) while no significant difference was found for likelihood to cook (p = 0.08). On average, clients owned 75% of kitchen appliances with most clients owning a sauté pan (94%) but few having access to a food processor (27%). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: An effective nutrition program for food pantry clients must be accessible, culturally relevant, nourishing, and enjoyable. Providing samples alongside recipes may increase appeal and engagement. Consideration of kitchen equipment access is essential to promote recipe recreation at home.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Partnering with the Housing Authority of Los Angeles, we launched a place-based initiative in the Nickerson Gardens housing development in South Los Angeles, where we apply our community engagement approach of listening and learning, and trust and relationship building, to deliver public health interventions in a discrete community. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Nickerson Gardens is the largest housing development in Los Angeles, with 1,066 units and over 3,000 residents. 58% and 40% of the residents are Hispanic and Black/African American respectively with an average yearly income of less than $30,000. To build trust and establish relationships, our team began attending community events, holding weekly educational workshops, and participating in the summer program for youth. We also held listening sessions in English and Spanish that asked aboutthe overall health of the Nickerson Gardens community, environment and public space, access and barriers to care, needed healthcare services, and the lived experience within Nickerson Gardens. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: To date, we have held eight 90-minute listening sessions in English and Spanish with 59 participants. The sessions provided insight into theneeded health and educational resources and services, the organizational structure of the housing development and how that impacts access to information and services, as well as the nuanced and area-specific transportation issues and the connection to safety concerns. These findings will inform the next phase of this initiative which includes convening a Coordinating Council composed of service providers and Nickerson Gardens residents. This council will oversee the coordination and implementation of needed services, help maintain accountability of the providers, and offer residents the opportunity to take ownership of the process.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Participating in out-of-school activities (i.e., sports) is associated with improved physical and mental health, but racial/ethnic and income disparities persist. Our goal was to describe parent perspectives to understand how to enhance family engagement in these activities, especially in low-income Black and Latinx communities. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We recruited parents through a large urban parks and recreation department located in Los Angeles County (LAC) and two community-based organizations who provide services primarily to low-income Black and Latinx residents in LAC. We conducted semi-structed English or Spanish interviews with parents of children ages 6-17 about the impact of activities on families, experiences making it difficult or easier for their child to be involved, and recommendations to meet their needs and facilitate family engagement. We coded the interviews using Dedoose and then performed thematic analysis. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We completed 34 interviews (17 English, 17 Spanish). Parents shared these central ideas about out-of-school activities: (1) they support families and promote healthy child development; (2) they must create a safe environment and promote a sense of belonging for all families; and (3) service delivery changes reduced barriers, but activities often remained inaccessible. Barriers included lack of awareness about low-cost options, online enrollment, financial costs, waitlists, program timing, inaccessible parks/pools, safety, inconsistent quality, few opportunities for families to participate together, and a desire for more inclusive practices around race, culture, language, gender, children with special needs, and parent involvement. Parents offered recommendations to increase family engagement. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Involving parents in optimizing out-of-school activities may improve access, uptake, and quality of these health-promoting activities in low-income Black and Latinx communities.",

        "abstract": "Aim Increasing evidence suggests that the inclusion of self-identified race in clinical decision algorithms may perpetuate longstanding inequities. Until recently, most pulmonary function tests utilized separate reference equations that are race/ethnicity based. Purpose We assess the magnitude and scope of the available literature on the negative impact of race-based pulmonary function prediction equations on relevant outcomes in African Americans with COPD. Methods We performed a scoping review utilizing an English language search on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science in September 2022 and updated it in December 2023. We searched for publications regarding the effect of race-specific vs race-neutral, race-free, or race-reversed lung function testing algorithms on the diagnosis of COPD and COPD-related physiologic and functional measures. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines were utilized for this scoping review. Eligibility criteria: The search was restricted to adults with COPD. We excluded publications on other lung disorders, non-English language publications, or studies that did not include African Americans. The search identified publications. Ultimately, six peer-reviewed publications and four conference abstracts were selected for this review. Results Removal of race from lung function prediction equations often had opposite effects in African Americans and Whites, specifically regarding the severity of lung function impairment. Symptoms and objective findings were better aligned when race-specific reference values were not used. Race-neutral prediction algorithms uniformly resulted in reclassifying severity in the African Americans studied. Conclusion The limited literature does not support the use of race-based lung function prediction equations. However, this assertion does not provide guidance for every specific clinical situation. For African Americans with COPD, the use of race-based prediction equations appears to fall short in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, classifying severity of impairment, or predicting subsequent clinical events. We do not have information comparing race-neutral vs race-based algorithms on prediction of progression of COPD. We conclude that the elimination of race-based reference values potentially reduces underestimation of disease severity in African Americans with COPD.",

        "abstract": "\n The purpose of this article is to identify early and recent Pentecostal studies in the West and to highlight the main difference between them. Today there are more than 250 million Pentecostals in the world, and together with the charismatic movement there are more than 500 million. Having begun to spread in the 20th century, the movement claims to be the fastest growing religious phenomenon in human history. In attempts to interpret the phenomenon of the movement's growth, there have been several gradually emerging approaches: explaining the origin of the movement as supernaturally \"coming from heaven\"; searching for the origins of Pentecostalism in other Christian movements; presenting the emergence of the movement as the result of social and psychological factors such as poverty, marginalization, and the desire to escape from modern society; and the multicultural approach. The paper analyzes the works of Western historians and theologians of Pentecostalism since the second half of the 20th century. The result shows a turning point between early and late studies, namely that late studies aim to revise the history and include participants in the movement around the world, not just in North America, explore the contribution to the development of the movement of local ministers who have long remained in the shadow of Western missionaries, emphasize the diversity of ideologies and social influences that have shaped the movement. It also highlights three major contemporary areas of research: historical, characterized by studies of Pentecostalism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; theological, focusing on the development and shaping of theoretical theology as a result of the movement's institutionalization; and religious studies, practiced primarily from the perspective of the sociology of religion.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background There are few qualitative studies of firearm injury survivors and hospital-based violence intervention programme (HVIP) participants. The original study aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to survivors’ utilisation of mental health services. This secondary analysis aimed to identify factors that may impact engagement with an HVIP. Study design This study was a subanalysis of an original qualitative study that used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semistructured interviews with English-speaking, intentional firearm injury survivors aged 13 and older within Indianapolis, Indiana between 2021 and 2022. Participants were recruited by a community organisation through a snowball sampling method. Interviews were analysed using manual thematic analysis. Themes were analysed and discussed in relation to HVIPs. Results A total of 18 interviews were completed. The majority of participants identified as black (17/18, 94.4%). Nearly all (75%) participants were between the ages of 13 and 24 years of age at the time of their shooting. During content analysis, five themes were identified: (1) delayed readiness to change, (2) desire for independence, (3) lack of trust, (4) persistent emotional and physical effects of trauma and (5) unawareness of HVIP resources. Conclusions This qualitative analysis of firearm injury survivor experiences provided insights for improved engagement with HVIPs. Continued pursuit of survivors for several years after their injury, improved dissemination of resources, establishing trust, and addressing persistent physical and psychological symptoms while respecting participants’ desire for independence may lead to increased engagement of firearm injury survivors with HVIPs.",

        "title": "Advance care planning as perceived by marginalized populations: Willing to engage and facing obstacles",
        "abstract": "Background Health disparities exist in end-of-life (EOL) care. Individuals and communities that are marginalized due to their race, ethnicity, income, geographic location, language, or cultural background experience systemic barriers to access and receive lower quality EOL care. Advance care planning (ACP) prepares patients and their caregivers for EOL decision-making for the purpose of promoting high-quality EOL care. Low engagement in ACP among marginalized populations is thought to have contributed to disparity in EOL care. To advance health equity and deliver care that aligns with the goals and values of each individual, there is a need to improve ACP for marginalized populations. Aim To describe how patients from marginalized populations experience and perceive ACP. Methods We used an interpretive phenomenological approach with semi-structured qualitative interviews. Participants were recruited from four primary care clinics and one nursing home in a US Pacific Northwest city. Thirty patients from marginalized populations with serious illness participated in individual interviews between January and December 2021. Participants were asked to describe their experiences and perceptions about ACP during the interviews. Results The mean age of 30 participants was 69.5; 19 (63%) were women; 12 (40%) identified as Asian/Pacific Islanders, 10 (33%) as Black; and 9 (30%) were non-native English speakers. Our three key findings were: 1) patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP; 2) there were multiple obstacles to engaging in ACP; and 3) meaningful ACP conversations could happen when clinicians listen. Although participants from marginalized populations were willing to engage in ACP, a fragmented and restrictive healthcare system and clinicians’ biased behaviors or lack of interest in knowing their patients were obstacles. Participants who felt their clinicians took time and listened were encouraged to engage in ACP. Conclusion Patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP conversations despite a common belief otherwise. However, obstacles to meaningful ACP conversations with healthcare providers exist. Clinicians need to be aware of these obstacles and listen to build trust and engage marginalized patients in mutually meaningful ACP conversations.",

        "abstract": "Background. Several disparities exist for Black mothers during the postpartum period, including but not limited to increased maternal mortality and morbidity rates, decreased access to care, and limited access to resources. Given the racial discrepancies in attention to postpartum care, coupled with the critical importance of the postpartum period for preventing adverse maternal health outcomes, research is warranted to explore how mobile health (mHealth) applications may help to alleviate maternal health disparities by optimizing postpartum care and addressing barriers to care for postpartum Black women. Thus, this review examines the perceptions of mHealth applications and their utility in health outcomes among postpartum Black women. Methods. We undertook a comprehensive literature search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We included peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2022 that were written in English, utilized mHealth as a primary intervention, and focused on postpartum health and access to resources, primarily among Black women in the United States. Results. A total of eight articles were included in our synthesis, encompassing mobile phone-based interventions for Black women. Cultural tailoring was included in five studies. Interventions that incorporated tailored content and fostered interactions reported high rates of follow-up. Conclusions. Tailored mHealth interventions can effectively promote behavior change and improve health care outcomes for Black women. However, there is a critical need for more research to assess user engagement and retention and whether these improvements indicate long-term sustainability.",

Brief, US-based English-language online messages were gathered from searchable media platforms, a process that yielded 112 anti-SSB videos and 29 pro-SSB commercials. Using a combination of inductive and deductive methods, a content analysis of those messages was conducted to identify their properties. They were coded for the direction (pro vs. anti), target of the advocacy (e.g., consumption vs. policy), actor demographics (gender, age, and ethnicity), persuasive theme (e.g., excessive sugar, nurturing), and message sensation value. Anti-SSB appeals primarily targeted individual-level consumption behavior. They utilized six persuasive themes and often included more than one theme in a single message. Pro-SSB messages used feel-good themes and utilized only one theme per message. The proportions of adults, adolescents, and children differed by the direction of the advocacy. Black, Hispanic, and Asian actors were under-represented in the anti-SSB sample relative to Whites. Pro-SSB appeals were slightly higher than anti-SSB appeals in message sensation value (p = 0.09). The findings illuminate the message features that characterize the universe of brief anti-SSB appeals available online, highlight messaging disparities, and reveal the absence of certain common, effective persuasive themes.",

While we propose that EDD Online is ‘intelligent’ in the sense that its retrieval software will anticipate and be capable of answering many of the questions that dialectologists would raise, we claim that the reason for such ‘intelligence’ is inherently rooted within the competence of humans in terms of predicting such questions and of eliciting the answers by means of complex query rules. We shall in fact argue that – as opposed to retrieval software types like the hotly debated ChatGPT chatbot, which are merely black box phenomena – EDD Online 4.0’s user interface represents a rare feature of AI: transparency and proactive user-friendliness.

This study examined the association between perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This study used data from REACH-US, a nationally representative online survey of a large, diverse sample of U.S. adults (N=5145 January 26, 2021-March 3, 2021). Confirmatory factor and regression analyses examined a latent factor of perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare, whether the factor was associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and whether associations varied across racial–ethnic groups reported as probit estimates (B) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were highest among Black/African American adults (mean latent factor score: 0.65 ± 0.43) and lowest among White adults (mean latent factor score: 0.04 ± 0.67). Black/African American (B = −0.08; 95% CI = −0.19, 0.03) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (B = −0.08; 95% CI = −0.23, 0.07) adults who perceived greater racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were less willing than participants who perceived lower inequities.

        "abstract": "Introduction The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides nutrition support for racially and ethnically diverse populations. In 2021, the monthly cash value benefit (CVB) for the purchase of fruits and vegetables increased from $9 to $35 and was later adjusted to $24. This study investigated, by racial and ethnic groups, whether CVB increases were associated with increases in CVB redemption, household food security, child fruit and vegetable intake, satisfaction with CVB amount, and likelihood of continued participation in WIC if the CVB returned to $9 per month. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of WIC participants (N = 1,770) in southern California at 3 time points, from April 2021 through May 2022; the CVB amount was $9 at baseline, $35 at Survey 2, and $24 at Survey 3. Racial and ethnic groups were Hispanic English-speakers, Hispanic Spanish-speakers, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Other, and non-Hispanic White. We used mixed-effect and modified Poisson regressions to evaluate outcomes by group. Results At baseline, groups differed significantly in dollars of CVB redeemed, percentage of CVB redeemed, household food security, and satisfaction with CVB amount. After the increase in CVB, we found increases in all groups in CVB redemption, household food security, and satisfaction. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic English-speaking groups, who had low levels of satisfaction at baseline, had larger increases in satisfaction than other groups. Reported likelihood of continued WIC participation if the monthly CVB returned to $9 also differed significantly by group, ranging from 62.5% to 90.0%. Conclusion The increase in CVB for children receiving WIC benefited all racial and ethnic groups. Continued investment in an augmented CVB could improve health outcomes for a racially and ethnically diverse WIC population.",

        "abstract": "Background Respect is essential to providing high quality healthcare, particularly for groups that are historically marginalized and stigmatized. While ethical principles taught to health professionals focus on patient autonomy as the object of respect for persons, limited studies explore patients’ views of respect. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of a multiculturally diverse group of low-income women living with HIV (WLH) regarding their experience of respect from their medical physicians. Methods We analyzed 57 semi-structured interviews conducted at HIV case management sites in South Florida as part of a larger qualitative study that explored practices facilitating retention and adherence in care. Women were eligible to participate if they identified as African American ( n  = 28), Hispanic/Latina ( n  = 22), or Haitian ( n  = 7). They were asked to describe instances when they were treated with respect by their medical physicians. Interviews were conducted by a fluent research interviewer in either English, Spanish, or Haitian Creole, depending on participant’s language preference. Transcripts were translated, back-translated and reviewed in entirety for any statements or comments about “respect.” After independent coding by 3 investigators, we used a consensual thematic analysis approach to determine themes. Results Results from this study grouped into two overarching classifications: respect manifested in physicians’ orientation towards the patient (i.e., interpersonal behaviors in interactions) and respect in medical professionalism (i.e., clinic procedures and practices). Four main themes emerged regarding respect in provider’s orientation towards the patient: being treated as a person, treated as an equal, treated without blame or prejudice, and treated with concern/emotional support. Two main themes emerged regarding respect as evidenced in medical professionalism: physician availability and considerations of privacy. Conclusions Findings suggest a more robust conception of what ‘respect for persons’ entails in medical ethics for a diverse group of low-income women living with HIV. Findings have implications for broadening areas of focus of future bioethics education, training, and research to include components of interpersonal relationship development, communication, and clinic procedures. We suggest these areas of training may increase respectful medical care experiences and potentially serve to influence persistent and known social and structural determinants of health through provider interactions and health care delivery.",

        "title": "Key language markers of depression on social media depend on race",
        "abstract": "Depression has robust natural language correlates and can increasingly be measured in language using predictive models. However, despite evidence that language use varies as a function of individual demographic features (e.g., age, gender), previous work has not systematically examined whether and how depression’s association with language varies by race. We examine how race moderates the relationship between language features (i.e., first-person pronouns and negative emotions) from social media posts and self-reported depression, in a matched sample of Black and White English speakers in the United States. Our findings reveal moderating effects of race: While depression severity predicts I-usage in White individuals, it does not in Black individuals. White individuals use more belongingness and self-deprecation-related negative emotions. Machine learning models trained on similar amounts of data to predict depression severity performed poorly when tested on Black individuals, even when they were trained exclusively using the language of Black individuals. In contrast, analogous models tested on White individuals performed relatively well. Our study reveals surprising race-based differences in the expression of depression in natural language and highlights the need to understand these effects better, especially before language-based models for detecting psychological phenomena are integrated into clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "In 1957 Abbott and Ballentine described a highly toxic activity from a dinoflagellate isolated from the English Channel. in 1949 by Mary Park. From a culture maintained at Plymouth Laboratory since 1950, we have been able to isolate two toxic molecules (Abbotoxin and 59-E-Chloro-Abbotoxin), determine the planar structures by analysis of HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectra and found them to be karlotoxin (KmTx) congeners. Both toxins kill larval zebrafish with symptoms identical to that described by Abbot and Ballantine for gobies (Gobius virescens). Using surface plasma resonance the sterol binding specificity of karlotoxins is shown to require desmethyl sterols. Our results with black lipid membranes indicate that karlotoxin forms large-conductance channels in the lipid membrane, which are characterized by large ionic conductance, poor ionic selectivity, and a complex gating behavior that exhibits strong voltage dependence and multiple gating patterns. In addition, we show that KmTx 2 pore formation is a highly targeted mechanism involving sterol-specificity. This is the first report of the functional properties of the membrane pores formed by karlotoxins and are consistent with the intial observations of Abbott and Ballentine from 1957.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAdherence to oral endocrine therapy (ET) remains an issue for up to half of women prescribed these medications. There is emerging data that Black breast cancer survivors (BCS) have lower rates of ET adherence. Given the disparities in breast cancer recurrence and survival for Black BCS compared to their White counterparts, the goal of this study is to better understand barriers to ET adherence among Black BCS from the patient and provider perspectives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews between October 29, 2021, and March 1, 2023. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and coded data were organized into primary and secondary themes. Participants were recruited from a single academic cancer center. A convenience sample of 24 Black BCS and 9 medical oncology providers was included. Eligible BCS were 18 years or older, English-speaking, diagnosed with stage I-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who had initiated ET.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean age of the BCS was 55 years (interquartile range, IQR 17 years). About one-fourth had a high school diploma or less (26.1%) and 47% completed a college education or higher. Approximately one-third of participants had annual household incomes of $40,000 or less (30.4%) or more than $100,000 (30.4%). Forty-three percent of the patient participants had private insurance; 11% were insured through Medicaid or the federal healthcare exchange; 26.1% had Medicare; and 13% were uninsured. Of the 9 medical oncology providers interviewed, 2 were advanced practice providers, and 7 were medical oncologists. We found 3 major themes: (1) Black BCS often had concerns about ET before initiation; (2) after initiation, both BCS and providers reported side effects as the most impactful barrier to ET adherence; and (3) survivors experienced challenges with managing ET side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that multifaceted support interventions for managing ET-related symptoms may lead to improved adherence to ET among Black women and may reduce disparities in outcomes.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS\nMultifaceted support interventions for managing ET-related symptoms may lead to improved adherence to ET among Black breast cancer survivors.",

        "abstract": "Since its release, the Netflix show, Bridgerton, has been a hit series among its mass audiences as it harnesses an average of 103,550,000 views per season and currently holds fourth place in Netflix’s most popular English-language series (Tudum, 2024). The show has gained immense popularity not only because of its captivating plotlines but also because of the diverse cast of characters placed within the Regency Era. From this, it is critical to dissect and understand how race is represented within the show to discern the discourses being perpetuated to its viewers. Throughout this essay, I will employ Stuart Hall’s theory of representation and the politics of signification to unpack the racial representation within the Netflix show, Bridgerton, and how it reproduces colour-blind casting, interracial relationships, and dark versus light symbolism to perpetuate post-racial and Orientalist discourses. This analysis explores how colour-blind casting sustains post-racial discourses in the disguise of escapist media, which strips the Other of their lived experience. Moreover, it highlights how the depiction of interracial relationships within the show contributes to both post-racial and Orientalist discourses by placing the Occident over the Orient, and disregarding the prejudice often faced by interracial couples during that period. It further reveals how dark versus light symbolism is embedded throughout the interactions between multiple characters, which elicits the disruption of the white imaginary by Black individuals. As the show progresses and continues to release seasons that reach such large audiences, it is crucial to analyze what discourses surrounding race are being perpetuated and its potential impact on reinforcing stereotypes and misrepresenting marginalized communities.",

        "title": "The first press release about the meetings of football teams in Mykolaіv",
        "abstract": "Local periodicals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were studied. and local history literature from the funds of the State Archive of the Mykolaiv Region, the National Library of Ukraine named after V. I. Vernadskyi, the Odesa National Scientific Library, and the Mykolaiv Regional Universal Scientific Library to find out the history of the beginning of the game of football in Mykolaiv. In the shipbuilding city of Mykolaiv, which was previously closed to foreigners, where the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Empire was located, the possibility of commercial ships entering began in 1862, when the Commercial Port was opened with permission for the entry of foreign ships to visit and stay in the city of foreigners. Mykolaiv became one of the important ports for grain trade, where many foreign representative offices and banks were opened, commercial shipbuilding began to develop, and the cultural life of the city intensified. According to later local studies, it was established that, based on the memories of contemporaries, the first football meetings in Mykolaiv were started at the end of the 19th century. foreign sailors of merchant ships. Having adopted football traditions from foreigners, in 1901–1902 the teams of the city gymnasium and real school played football, and from 1906, the teams of the mechanical and technical school. At this time, street and district city football teams are created. Despite the fact that the first friendly meetings of football teams took place at the end of the 19th century, reports about the matches appeared in the local press only at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908, Charles Bate, an employee of the bread office, organized the \"Zebra\" team, which played with foreigners and teams from educational institutions and sports clubs both in Mykolaiv and Odesa. Football matches took place on adapted sites, first near the Commercial Port, and later in different areas of the city. The referees of the matches were elected collegially from representatives of both opposing teams. Football matches were played according to English rules. The game of football at the time of its coverage in the local press was popular among the townspeople, especially among the youth of educational institutions, intelligentsia, and port workers. Newspaper articles cite examples of the presence of a significant number of spectators and fans, in connection with which the police had to be called in to maintain order. Local periodicals published not only announcements about scheduled meetings of football teams, notes with analysis of matches and their results, but also training schedules and sportsmen's runs around the city. Press publications announcing scheduled meetings, emotions from matches, the opportunity to observe and participate in joint training with popular athletes in the city contributed to the spread of football in the city. Most often, notes about football matches were printed by the \"Nikolaevskaya newspaper\", popular among the townspeople, with which a sports journalist probably cooperated, who did not indicate his surname or sign his authorship with the cryptonym Z-a.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Population size estimation (PSE) for key populations is needed to inform HIV programming and policy. Objective This study aimed to examine the utility of applying a recently proposed method using Google Trend (GT) internet search data to generate PSE (Google Trends Population Size Estimate [GTPSE]) for men who have sex with men (MSM) in 54 countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Methods We examined GT relative search volumes (representing the relative internet search frequency of specific search terms) for “porn” and, as a comparator term, “gay porn” for the year 2020. We assumed “porn” represents “men” (denominator) while “gay porn” represents a subset of “MSM” (numerator) in each county, resulting in a proportional size estimate for MSM. We multiplied the proportional GTPSE values with the countries’ male adult population (15‐49 years) to obtain absolute size estimates. Separately, we produced subnational MSM PSE limited to countries’ (commercial) capitals. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the effect of countries’ levels of urbanization, internet penetration, criminalization of homosexuality, and stigma on national GTPSE results. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in a subset of countries (n=14) examining the effect of alternative English search terms, different language search terms (Spanish, French, and Swahili), and alternative search years (2019 and 2021). Results One country was excluded from our analysis as no GT data could be obtained. Of the remaining 53 countries, all national GTPSE values exceeded the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum PSE threshold of 1% (range 1.2%‐7.5%). For 44 out of 49 (89.8%) of the countries, GTPSE results were higher than Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Key Population Atlas values but largely consistent with the regional UNAIDS Global AIDS Monitoring results. Substantial heterogeneity across same-region countries was evident in GTPSE although smaller than those based on Key Population Atlas data. Subnational GTPSE values were obtained in 51 out of 53 (96%) countries; all subnational GTPSE values exceeded 1% but often did not match or exceed the corresponding countries’ national estimates. None of the covariates examined had a substantial effect on the GTPSE values (R2 values 0.01‐0.28). Alternative (English) search terms in 12 out of 14 (85%) countries produced GTPSE>1%. Using non-English language terms often produced markedly lower same-country GTPSE values compared with English with 10 out of 14 (71%) countries showing national GTPSE exceeding 1%. GTPSE used search data from 2019 and 2021, yielding results similar to those of the reference year 2020. Due to a lack of absolute search volume data, credibility intervals could not be computed. The validity of key assumptions, especially who (males and females) searches for porn and gay porn, could not be assessed. Conclusions GTPSE for MSM provides a simple, fast, essentially cost-free method. Limitations that impact the certainty of our estimates include a lack of validation of key assumptions and an inability to assign credibility intervals. GTPSE for MSM may provide an additional data source, especially for estimating national-level PSE.",

        "abstract": "Sociolinguistic research has demonstrated that ‘urban contact dialects’ tend to diffuse beyond the speech communities in which they first emerge. However, no research has attempted to explore the distribution of these varieties across an entire nation nor isolate the social mechanisms that propel their spread. In this paper, we use a corpus of 1.8 billion geo‐tagged tweets to explore the spread of Multicultural London English (MLE) lexis across the United Kingdom. We find evidence for the diffusion of MLE lexis from East and North London into other ethnically and culturally diverse urban centres across England, particularly those in the South (e.g. Luton), but find lower frequencies of MLE lexis in the North of England (e.g. Manchester), and in Scotland and Wales. Concluding, we emphasise the role of demographic similarity in the diffusion of linguistic innovations by demonstrating that this variety originated in London and diffused into other urban areas in England through the social networks of Black and Asian users.",

        "abstract": "The article examines the problem of inadequate sanitary condition of the English capital in the 14th century and the attempts taken by official authorities – royal and municipal – to solve it, incl. against the backdrop of a plague epidemic. Based on the royal orders addressed to the London magistrate and the data from research literature, the author identifies and characterizes the main steps of the Crown and City administrations aimed at correcting the situation, considering, in particular, the history of the creation of two new cemeteries: East and West Smithfield and some controversial issues associated with it, for example, the problem of the authorship of the project, its implementation and the degree of the government’s participation in that. Estimates of the number, age and gender composition of the victims of the Black Death buried here are also provided. The results of the investigation lead the author to the conclusion that, despite its obvious significance, the issue of the neglected sanitary condition of London did not receive a comprehensive solution in the century under review, since it became relevant only if a critical level risked being reached, when, due to objective reasons, it could no longer be ignored. This also determined the impossibility of developing those few measures taken into a full-fledged state policy. At the same time, the need for changes in the field of municipal hygiene, aggravated by the epidemic, contributed to the intensification of public initiative, supported or directed by the monarch. Thus, a new impetus was given to the dialogue between the royal and municipal authorities in the development and implementation of a unified sanitation policy. In addition, addressing the topic under consideration is of great practical importance for reconstructing the picture of the daily life of a medieval city in an emergency and its preparedness for such trials making it possible to clarify the scale of the Black Death in London.",

        "abstract": "Polandball, or Countryballs, are online user-generated comics about geopolitical satire, with countries personified in spherical characters. One of the most important aspects of Countryball memes is the non-standard English, or Engrish, used in the conversations between characters. This research delves into the Engrish phenomena by collecting and qualitatively examining 200+ comics in the subreddit r/polandball, proposing plausible causes of the phenomena, and raising concerns regarding the implications of the exhibited linguistic stereotypes. The investigation figures out that the language choice in Polandball comics on Reddit generally ranged between serious cultural misunderstanding and code-switching of English with another language. It is concluded that the linguistic stylizations of non-standard English in Polandball comics might be rooted in certain cultural and racial stereotypes and might further reinforce these biased cross-cultural perceptions. The research shed light on the long-ignored African-American Vernacular English appropriation in Polandball comics, and extensively enumerated and identified the most recent Engrish stylizations in Polandball comics.",

The way in which the play represents the tensions between inside and outside is however particularly provocative.

        "abstract": "Birutė Marija Alseikaitė-Gimbutienė (English Marija Gimbutas), is one of the most prominent and well-known archaeologists of the 20th century, pioneer of archaeomythology, creator of new theories in archaeology. In her scientific research, she paid a great attention to the ethnic origins and development of nations.This article analyzes the Theory of Baltic Ethnic Origins formulated by Gimbutas. The solution to this important scientific problem involves two main research stages. The first stage is formulation of the Theory of Indo-European homeland, named the Kurgans Theory. The second stage is formulation of the Theory of the origins of Balts. According to Gimbutas, a few cultural systems participated in the formation of the Balts: the indoeuropeans and substrat culture, that is Indo-Europeanized people of Central Europe. The Indo-Europeans migrated from their homeland, located in the steppe zone north of the Black and Caspian seas, in three waves between 4400/4200 and 3000/2800 BC, ultimately reaching Europe and Indo-Europeanizing it.A secondary Indo-European Homeland was formed in Central Europe, from which the Indo-European culture spread to the Baltic region and other European regions.The last, third wave of newcomers, from around 3000–2800 BC, had the greatest influence on the southeastern and eastern Baltic region and the surrounding territories. During several centuries of assimilation between local inhabitants and newcomers, around 2500–2000 BC, in the territory between the Vistula River in the west and the Volga and Oka rivers in the east, several cultural groups of Proto-Balts were formed. During further ethnocultural processes, around 2000 BC. the Baltic ethnos was formed. In the 2nd and 1st millennium BC. and in the first part of the 1st millennium AD the Balts inhabited a huge area in the North Eastern part of Europe.",

        "abstract": "Background and objectives Transgender and gender diverse (trans) health research has grown rapidly, highlighting the need to characterize the scientific evidence base. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on disease burden and correlates in trans adolescents and adults over a 20-month period to identify knowledge gaps and assess methodological characteristics including measurement of gender identity, community engagement, and study quality. Data sources, eligibility criteria, and synthesis methods We searched seven databases using terms related to (a) transgender populations and (b) health or disease. Eligible studies were in English, French, or Spanish and reported original quantitative data on mental health or substance use conditions, infectious diseases, or non-communicable conditions in at least 25 trans individuals aged 15+. Quality assessment was performed in duplicate on a 10% sample of articles and findings were summarized using narrative synthesis. Results The 328 included studies were conducted in 45 countries, with most from North America (54%) and limited research from South Asia (3%), Sub-Saharan Africa (3%), and the Middle East and North Africa (2%). Most studies used cross-sectional designs (73%) and convenience sampling (65%). Only 30% of studies reported any form of community engagement. Mental health and substance use disorders were the most studied area (77% of studies) and non-communicable conditions the least (16%). Available data indicated that trans populations experience high disease burden with considerable heterogeneity within and across settings. Of 39 articles assessed for quality, 80% were rated as fair, 18% as poor, and 3% as good quality. Conclusions and implications Geographic, gender-specific, and topical gaps remain in trans health, but we found more research from African countries, with transmasculine people, and on non-communicable conditions than previous syntheses. Areas for growth in trans health research include community engagement, non-binary health, chronic and age-related conditions, and health determinants. Registration PROSPERO CRD42021234043.",

        "abstract": "Travelling mostly involves expenditure on products beyond daily consumables (i.e. tourism shopping), but sometimes tourists visit a country with the specific intention of acquiring goods unique to that particular context, either for personal or commercial use. This type of “shopping tourism” contributes to the growth of luxury markets such as the exotic leather industry. In stimulating shopping tourism and promoting the local exotic leather industry, it is crucial to understand tourists’ underlying perceptions and sustainable values that influence their luxury shopping behaviour. Using animal skins to create fashion accessories involves several environmental concerns and remains controversial among American and Chinese consumers, who rank among the world’s top luxury goods spenders. This research, therefore, investigated American and Chinese shopping tourists’ luxury value perceptions, sustainability excellence perceptions, and purchase intent for South African exotic leather products. Data was derived from a purposive sample including both American and Chinese tourists, aged 25 years and older, who had either visited South Africa in the past or intended to visit the country soon. A structured online questionnaire consisting of scales adapted from prior empirical research was developed. The English version of the questionnaire was translated into Mandarin and Cantonese for Chinese tourists. Data analysis involved two structural equation models (one based on the American and another on the Chinese tourists’ responses) to test hierarchical relationships among variables. The results confirm that personal luxury value strongly influences sustainability excellence and the purchase intent of exotic leather products for both American and Chinese respondents. These findings highlight the potential of positioning South Africa as a luxury shopping tourism destination for exotic leather products, thus contributing toward economic growth and employment opportunities. However, environmental concerns must be addressed to conform to Eastern and Western tourists' sustainable luxury value perceptions.",

        "abstract": "\n\n\nImplementing effective, affordable and ethical conservation management will be crucial for minimising future biodiversity losses. Such management requires reliable foundational evidence to help managers make informed choices about how to address the needs of their target species. Unfortunately, such evidence is still lacking for many species and management scenarios.\n\nOne major global challenge is improving the reproductive success of threatened species in the context of predation. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of in situ experiments that used non‐lethal methods to protect bird nests against predators, with the aims of summarising global trends in nest protection efforts, comparing the effectiveness of different protection measures and informing future research and management. We considered peer‐reviewed studies in English.\n\nWe detected a large geographic and taxonomic bias in the evidence base with 58% of articles conducted in North America and 76% on ground‐nesting birds. Less than 3% of articles involved taxa listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered and 51% of study units lasted just a single breeding season.\n\nNests protected with exclosures, fences and guards were more likely to be successful than their unprotected controls. Interventions involving deterrents, conditioned taste aversion, chemical camouflage and diversionary feeding did not have a significant positive effect on nest success, but the interventions in these categories were less common and more diverse in nature.\n\nSynthesis and applications. To increase their conservation value, future non‐lethal nest protection experiments should whenever possible clearly state overall aims, take place over multiple seasons, use a comparable control and test non‐lethal protection methods independently of lethal predator control. Greater focus is required on under‐studied taxa such as cup‐nesting songbirds and birds in South America, Africa and Asia, and novel protection techniques such as deterrents and chemical camouflage. Practitioners should consider the evidence we synthesise here when deciding whether non‐lethal nest protection approaches are optimal for their study system, to increase conservation success and reduce ethical and financial costs.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. Methods The search was conducted for journals that published articles in the English language, peer-reviewed, meeting the following criteria: a) randomized clinical trials, b) randomized studies in animals or humans, c) in vitro studies, d) studies using hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides, d) studies assessing alterations on fibroblasts as primary or secondary outcome. We utilized the main journal databases PUBMED/WEB OF SCIENCE and ongoing reviews by PROSPERO. For bias risk and methodological quality, we used an adaptation of the Downs and Black checklist. Our review followed the PRISMA checklist, conducted from February 2024 to the first week of March 2024, by two independent researchers (P.A.Q.I. and R.P.V.). Results Eleven studies were included in this review, where our findings reinforce the notion that hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides at concentrations of 50-500 μg/ml are sufficient to stimulate fibroblasts in human and animal tissues without inducing toxicity. Different enzymatic processes may confer distinct biological properties to collagens, allowing for scenarios favoring fibroblast promotion or antioxidant effects. Lastly, collagens with lower molecular weights exhibit greater bioavailability to adjacent tissues. Conclusion Hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides with molecular sizes ranging from <3 - 3000 KDa promote the stimulation of fibroblasts in human tissues.",

        "abstract": "Background Breastfeeding has long-lasting effects on children’s cognition, behavioral, mental and physical health. Previous research shows parental characteristics (e.g., education, race/ethnicity, income level) are associated with breastfeeding initiation and duration. Further, research shows significant variation in access to community resources by race/ethnicity. It is unclear how community resources may impact breastfeeding practices and how this might intersect with maternal race/ethnicity. Methods This study combined nationally-representative data from the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting Infant Care (SAFE), which surveyed US mothers immediately after the infant’s birth and at two to six months of infant age, with the Child Opportunity Index (COI) 2.0, a census tract measure of community resources associated with child development, to explore the association between community resources and breastfeeding initiation and whether this varies based on maternal race/ethnicity and country of birth. The SAFE Study used a stratified, two-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers of infants, while oversampling Hispanic and non-Hispanic (NH) Black mothers. The SAFE study enrolled mothers who spoke English or Spanish across 32 US birth hospitals between January 2011 and March 2014. Results After accounting for individual characteristics, mothers residing in the highest-resourced communities (compared to the lowest) had significantly greater likelihood of breastfeeding. Representation in higher-resourced communities differed by race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity did not significantly moderate the association between community resources and breastfeeding. In examining within race/ethnic groups, however, community resources were not associated with non-US born Black and Hispanic mothers’ rates of breastfeeding, while they were with US born Black and Hispanic mothers. Conclusions Findings suggest that even health behaviors like breastfeeding, which we often associate with individual choice, are connected to the community resources within which they are made. Study implications point to the importance of considering the impact of the contextual factors that shape health and as a potential contributor to understanding the observed race/ethnicity gap.",

So, we analyzed the frequency of five AAVE syntactic structures in different music genres - hip hop and rap - in distinct phases of her career. The results show an overall decrease of SE forms and an increase in the use of AAVE forms, though the singer continues to practice code-switching in her songwriting.

        "title": "Experiences of Aging with Opioid Use Disorder and Comorbidity in Opioid Treatment Programs: A Qualitative Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background The number of older adults entering opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing. However, the lived experiences of aging in OTPs have not been examined. Objective To explore the aging experience with OUD and barriers to medical care for older adults who receive care in OTPs. Design From November 2021 to July 2022, we conducted 1-to-1, semi-structured qualitative interviews in English and Spanish, audio-recorded, transcribed, systematically coded, and analyzed to identify key themes regarding the challenges of aging with OUD and managing chronic diseases. Participants Thirty-six adults aged ≥ 55 enrolled in OTPs in San Diego, California. Approach A descriptive qualitative approach was used. Major themes and subthemes were identified through thematic analysis until thematic saturation was reached. Key Results All participants were on methadone and had a mean age of 63.4 (SD 5.1) years; 11 (30.6%) identified as female, 14 (39%) as Hispanic/Latino, and 11 (36%) as Black, with a mean duration of methadone treatment of 5.6 years. Chronic diseases were common, with 21 (58.3%) reporting hypertension, 9 (25%) reporting untreated hepatitis C, and 32 (88.9%) having ≥ 2 chronic diseases. Three major themes emerged: (1) avoidance of medical care due to multiple intersectional stigmas, including those related to drug use, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, ageism, and housing insecurity; (2) increasing isolation with aging and loss of family and peer groups; (3) the urgent need for integrating medical and aging-focused care with OUD treatment in the setting of increasing health and functional challenges. Conclusions Older adults with OUD reported increasing social isolation and declining health while experiencing multilevel stigma and discrimination. The US healthcare system must transform to deliver age-friendly care that integrates evidence-based geriatric models of care incorporated with substance use disorder treatment and addresses the intersectional stigma this population has experienced in healthcare settings.

        "abstract": "Legal secularism and political participation \nABSTRACT: As is well known, the Italian term ‘laicità’ is polysemic and cannot be adequately translated into English. The word ‘secularism’, in fact, only captures certain senses of ‘laicità’. Ultimately, we are dealing with a very complex phenomenon that surely cannot be analyzed with a dichotomic black and white concept. In this paper we are mainly interested in highlighting legal secularism, understood as neutrality. However, we must pay attention to the fact that liberal neutrality, understood as mutual tolerance and impartiality of institutions, is a “committed neutrality” which deeply differs from Max Weber’s uncommitted neutrality to which scientists aspire. On the other hand, the ideal of legal secularism comes into harsh conflict with the partisan spirit that characterizes political life. Democracy is not only respect for rules, but must come to terms with the citizens’ variegated senses of belonging to this or that community. As they say: “My country, right or wrong”. Precisely because of these limits to rational discourse, we believe that legal secularism, in a broad sense, is not fully achievable even in an open society. \nSOMMARIO: 1.

        "abstract": "In 2016 the English Supreme Court changed the law concerning joint enterprise liablity ub R v Jogee. The decision appeared to provide a remedy for secondary parties that had been convicted under the, albeit faithful application of the old law. The requirement, however, to demonstrate a substantial injustice following the subsequent case of Johnson significantly curtailed the number of appeals based on this change in the law. The substantial injustice test is applied by the English Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) prior to the application of the statutory real possibility test. Up until now, there has not been any research that examines the impact of this situation and the extent that it constricts any remedy for secondary parties convicted under joint enterprise liability.  Using findings from the first study to explore this concept this work examines the limiting effect of the substantial injustice test on the CCRC, explores the application of the corrected law from Jogee, and shows the low number of applicants to the CCRC that identify as black British, despite existing research suggesting this demographic has the highest conviction rate for joint enterprise.",

        "abstract": "We investigated 14 antibiotic residues in 8 marketed freshwater fish species from southeast China and estimated the associated health risks to local consumers. The antibiotic residues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. Our findings revealed widespread distribution of quinolones (QNs), tetracyclines (TCs), and chloramphenicols (CAPs) in the freshwater fish. Notably, the average concentrations of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin reached levels as high as 62.5 μg/kg wet weight (ww) and 11.7 μg/kg ww, respectively, and detection frequencies were 68.7% for enrofloxacin and 31.6% for ciprofloxacin. Additionally, we detected chloramphenicol, a prohibited antibiotic, in samples with a detection frequency of 0.76%. Among the fish species, the mean concentration of total antibiotic residues was highest in bluntnose black bream (263.3 μg/kg), followed by English perch (52.4 μg/kg), crucian carp (46.3 μg/kg), black carp (28.6 μg/kg), yellowcheek carp (21.0 μg/kg), grass carp (15.3 μg/kg), bighead carp (3.78 μg/kg), and mandarin fish (3.69 μg/kg). We estimated the daily intake values of these antibiotic residues which were lower than the acceptable daily intake values and hazard indexes were much less than 1. It indicates that there is very low direct health risk to consumers. Despite that, investigation on the chronic impact, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria, gut microbiota disruption, and allergic reactions, is urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe 'Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index' (ANU-ADRI) assesses the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a potential tool for its prevention.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study is to adapt the ANU-ADRI-SF (the short version of ANU-ADRI) into the Turkish language and Turkish cultural context.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was methodological and involved the translation and intercultural adaptation of the ANU-ADRI-SF into the Turkish language. The study included 384 community-based participants from a province in the Western Black Sea Region of Türkiye. Data was collected via an online form prepared using Google Forms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe index was translated from its original language, English, into Turkish and then retranslated to English by bilingual translators. It was then reviewed and evaluated for possible issues related to translation and degrees of equivalence. When TR-ANU-ADRI-SF levels were compared according to sex, the mean risk scores were found to be 11.25 ± 7.02 for males and 11.69 ± 7.99 for females. After cross-cultural adaptation, the TR-ANU-ADRI-SF was conceptually intelligible to Turkish adults.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe TR-ANU-ADRI-SF is a valid and reliable AD risk assessment tool.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nGiven the increase in AD and its impact on people's health, there is a great need for strategies to be implemented by health professionals to improve the lifestyle of the adult population. For use in conjunction with these strategies, a localised AD risk assessment tool that can be applied by clinicians or by individual patients has been adapted and introduced to the Turkish literature.",

        "abstract": "Background Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are maternity-related increases in blood pressure (eg, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia). Compared with women of other races in high-income countries, Black women have a comparatively higher risk of an HDP. Intersectionality helps to provide a deeper understanding of the multifactorial identities that affect health outcomes in this high-risk population. Objective In this review, we sought to explore the literature on HDP risk factors in Black women living in high-income countries and to assess the interaction of these risk factors using the conceptual framework of intersectionality. Methods We conducted this review using the Arksey and O'Malley methodology with enhancements from Levac and colleagues. Published articles in English on HDP risk factors with a sample of not less than 10% of Black women in high-income countries were included. Six databases, theses, and dissertations were searched from January 2000 to July 2021. A thematic analysis was used to summarize the results. Results A final total of 36 studies were included from the 15 480 studies retrieved; 4 key themes of HDP risks were identified: (1) biological; (2) individual traditional; (3) race and ethnicity, geographical location, and immigration status; and (4) gender related. These intersectional HDP risk factors intersect to increase the risk of HDP among Black women living in high-income countries. Conclusion Upstream approaches are recommended to lower the risks of HDP in this population.",

This article specifically explores narrative accounts of two first generation Black African immigrant students’ educational navigation and their English as Second Language (ESL) and special education experiences. A pluralistic theoretical approach including Disability Critical Race Studies (DisCrit) and Ethnic Racial Identity (ERI) Formation framework is employed. The author proposes a disability-integrated ERI (D-ERI) framework. Some important findings from participant narratives suggest their awareness of the ESL as a formalized system leading to special education placement, and their acts of resistance against the deficit perceptions about their intersectional ethnic-racial identities in U.S. schools.",

        "abstract": "Background: Modern penitentiary systems attach great importance, at least in the area of formal and codified arrangements, to providing inmates with access to health care and rehabilitation. The aim of our study was to analyze the Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS medical databases in order to search for and evaluate the available literature discussing the oral status and dental treatment needs of adult male prisoners. Methods: The following terms were used: prisoners or inmates; oral health, oral status; periodontal status, periodontal disease; oral hygiene; caries; mucosa; and saliva. The studies were screened based on their title and abstract according to the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcome) criteria. The research protocol was prepared on the basis of the 2020 PRISMA guidelines and was not registered. The available literature discussing the oral status and dental treatment needs of adult imprisoned patients was analyzed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: articles published in English between 1 January 2012 and 2022; articles discussing the oral cavity status of adult inmates over 18 years old (hard tissues, periodontal status, saliva, mucosa condition, or oral hygiene); articles with a full text available; and articles that were assessed as satisfactory according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: A total of 934 articles were identified, out of which 9 were included in the systematic review. Two articles discussed the oral condition of prisoners in Europe (Russia and Finland), four examined prisoners in Asia (three in India and one in Saudi Arabia), two examined prisoners in Africa (Nigeria), and one examined prisoners in the Americas (Brazil). Conclusions: The oral status of prisoners has been widely discussed in the available literature. Among inmates, a higher frequency of both caries and periodontal disease along with poorer oral hygiene were observed. It can be concluded that inmates should have access to specialized treatment from periodontists and endodontists.",

        "abstract": "A large proportion of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) identify as Black or African American (AA). Social bias and stigma in healthcare outcomes for children with SCD are impossible to explore without considering the impact of racial/cultural identity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geography. It is important to understand the current influences of social movements, expanded health insurance coverage, and telehealth on these variables when considering healthcare outcomes for patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to determine the roles of racial identity, SES, and geography in healthcare outcomes for the pediatric population of children with SCD in the United States (US). This study is a scoping review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases utilized included Cochrane, CINHAL, Medline, and Nursing and Allied Health Collection, all accessed through the EBSCO Information Services. Studies met the following inclusion criteria: published in English, pediatric patients residing in the US, and published between 2017 and 2022. Search terms included “sickle cell” AND “pediatric”, which were then combined with “minority” OR “racial” OR “rural” OR “urban” OR “poverty” OR “income” OR \"socioeconomic status”. The initial search yielded 635 unique articles, with 17 articles meeting full inclusion criteria. Overall, it was clear that there are examples of positive effects of race, low SES, and rural geographic location on positive health outcomes, though a large number of studies oscillated between showing negative associations or no association at all. Barriers to care for patients with SCD are multifaceted, making it difficult to isolate and analyze the impact of individual variables. Many studies demonstrated the significance of family, community, and institutional relationships as positive support for patients with SCD. This review highlights the need for additional research on the healthcare outcome benefits of patient/familial support groups aiming to bring together patients who share racial experience and SCD diagnosis regardless of SES and geography.",

The available evidence, however, is limited to language comprehension. We tested the production of emotional words in Polish (L1)–English (L2) bilinguals in two EEG studies that manipulated emotional cueing. In Experiment 1 (neutral context), white or black circles indicated whether participants should read aloud (shadow) or translate a subsequently presented word. N400 amplitudes were selectively reduced for negative L2 words regardless of the task. In Experiment 2 (emotional context), we used black or white emojis, either sad or neutral, as cues. The previous interaction between word valence and language of operation vanished, but late positive potential amplitudes elicited by negative words were larger for translation from L2 to L1 (i.e., production in Polish) than L1 to L2. These results validate and extend to production previous findings of attenuated emotional response in L2 comprehension.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to conduct a pest categorisation of Garella musculana (Erschov) (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), following a commodity risk assessment of Juglans regia plants for planting from Türkiye, in which G. musculana was identified as a pest of possible concern to the European Union (EU). Commonly known as the Asian walnut moth, this pest is native to Central Asia and develops on shoots, buds and fruits of Juglans species such as the English walnut, J. regia and the black walnut, J. nigra. Other reported host plants, such as Prunus dulcis and Populus spp., still require confirmation. The pest was first recorded in the EU (Bulgaria) in 2016 and was then reported in Romania in 2018 and Italy in 2021. This moth completes from one to four generations per year depending on environmental conditions (from valley to mountain forests and orchards up to an altitude of 2100 m). Eggs are laid in groups of 2–3 on young nuts or on buds of 1‐year‐old shoots. Neonate larvae usually enter the young nut through the peduncle. After fully exploiting one nut, the larva continues feeding in another one. Development takes 25–40 days. Larvae of the autumn generation do not enter the nuts, and so feed only in the pericarp. Larvae also often feed inside 1‐year‐old shoots or leaf axils. Larvae develop within the host but exit to pupate under loose bark or in deep cracks of bark. The pest overwinters at the larval or pupal stages. Plants for planting, cut branches and infested nuts provide pathways for entry. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern and central EU MSs have allowed this species to establish and spread in Bulgaria, Romania and Italy. Adults can fly and the pest could spread naturally within the EU. Impact on Juglans spp. cultivated for fruit, timber and ornamental purposes is anticipated. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread of G. musculana. This species meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.",

        "abstract": "The nutritive value of mulberry leaves makes it the only food of silkworms (Bombyx mori L.). It is recorded that 6.73 million hectares of area are affected by salinity and sodicity stresses covering various states of the country, which is becoming one of the major threats to popularizing sericulture in India. In the present study, chlorophyll, protein, catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase content of leaves of six mulberry germplasm viz., English Black, Kolitha-3, C776, Rotundiloba, BC259, and S1 grown under coastal saline soils of South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India was investigated. Results demonstrated a sharp decrease in the chlorophyll (2.35 to1.19 mg.g FW-1) and protein (30.10 to 15.20 mg.g FW-1) contents of leaves of all the mulberry germplasm with increasing soil salinity (1.60 to 22.70 dS.m-1). On the contrary, the number of stress-related antioxidant enzymes like catalase, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase increased from 1.15 to 5.43, 1.43 to 4.76, and 8.65 to 25.15 g-1 FW.min-1, respectively. Overall, the field study indicated the superiority of Kolitha-3 and C776 grown in Canning (Canning I and II), Basanti, Namkhana, Kakdwip, and Sagar blocks of coastal regions of South 24 Parganas. The study deals with issues of the utilization of scarce land promoting income-generating avenues like sericulture in saline areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: English walnuts are the walnut species of choice for nut production. In the United States, edible English walnuts are almost exclusively produced in California, using soil and water resources on more than 370,000 acres. Scion cultivars of English walnuts are grafted onto rootstocks. Traditional rootstocks are seedling populations of socalled Paradox hybrids generated from crosses of black walnut with English walnut. These rootstocks are susceptible to soil-borne diseases, including crown gall, Phytophthora root and crown rot, and plantparasitic nematodes. Strategies to respond to these diseases include the use of newly developed clonal walnut rootstocks with genetic resistance. In a survey conducted during 2020 through 2021, walnut growers revealed their willingness to pay higher prices for clonal walnut rootstocks with some disease resistance. The survey showed that they were most concerned with crown gall and nematodes, and were willing to pay significant price premiums for rootstocks that are resistant to these pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social group–based identities intersect. The meaning of “woman” is modulated by adding social class as in “rich woman” or “poor woman.” How does such intersectionality operate at-scale in everyday language? Which intersections dominate (are most frequent)? What qualities (positivity, competence, warmth) are ascribed to each intersection? In this study, we make it possible to address such questions by developing a stepwise procedure, Flexible Intersectional Stereotype Extraction (FISE), applied to word embeddings (GloVe; BERT) trained on billions of words of English Internet text, revealing insights into intersectional stereotypes. First, applying FISE to occupation stereotypes across intersections of gender, race, and class showed alignment with ground-truth data on occupation demographics, providing initial validation. Second, applying FISE to trait adjectives showed strong androcentrism (Men) and ethnocentrism (White) in dominating everyday English language (e.g. White + Men are associated with 59% of traits; Black + Women with 5%). Associated traits also revealed intersectional differences: advantaged intersectional groups, especially intersections involving Rich, had more common, positive, warm, competent, and dominant trait associates. Together, the empirical insights from FISE illustrate its utility for transparently and efficiently quantifying intersectional stereotypes in existing large text corpora, with potential to expand intersectionality research across unprecedented time and place. This project further sets up the infrastructure necessary to pursue new research on the emergent properties of intersectional identities.",

        "abstract": "Background Historically, golf does not have a strong tradition of fitness testing and physical training. However, in recent years, both players and practitioners have started to recognise the value of a fitter and healthier body, owing to its potential positive impacts on performance, namely clubhead speed (CHS). Objective The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the associations between CHS (as measured using a driver) and a variety of physical characteristics. Methods A systematic literature search with meta-analysis was conducted using Medline, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and PubMed databases. Inclusion criteria required studies to have (1) determined the association between physical characteristics assessed in at least one physical test and CHS, (2) included golfers of any skill level but they had to be free from injury and (3) been peer-reviewed and published in the English language. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black Quality Index tool and heterogeneity assessed via the Q statistic and I2. To provide summary effects for each of the physical characteristics and their associations with CHS, a random effects model was used where z-transformed r values (i.e. zr) were computed to enable effect size pooling within the meta-analysis. Results Of the 3039 studies initially identified, 20 were included in the final analysis. CHS was significantly associated with lower body strength (zr = 0.47 [95% confidence intervals {CI} 0.24–0.69]), upper body strength (zr = 0.48 [95% CI 0.28–0.68]), jump displacement (zr = 0.53 [95% CI 0.28–0.78]), jump impulse (zr = 0.82 [95% CI 0.63–1.02]), jumping peak power (zr = 0.66 [95% CI 0.53–0.79]), upper body explosive strength (zr = 0.67 [95% CI 0.53–0.80]), anthropometry (zr = 0.43 [95% CI 0.29–0.58]) and muscle capacity (zr = 0.17 [95% CI 0.04–0.31]), but not flexibility (zr = − 0.04 [95% CI − 0.33 to 0.26]) or balance (zr =  − 0.06 [95% CI − 0.46 to 0.34]). Conclusions The findings from this meta-analysis highlight a range of physical characteristics are associated with CHS. Whilst significant associations ranged from trivial to large, noteworthy information is that jump impulse produced the strongest association, upper body explosive strength showed noticeably larger associations than upper body strength, and flexibility was not significant. These findings can be used to ensure practitioners prioritise appropriate fitness testing protocols for golfers.",

        "abstract": "Introduction People living with type 2 diabetes who experience homelessness face a myriad of barriers to engaging in diabetes self-care behaviors that lead to premature complications and death. This is exacerbated by high rates of comorbid mental illness, substance use disorder, and other physical health problems. Despite strong evidence to support lay health coach and behavioral activation, little research has effectively engaged people living with type 2 diabetes who had experienced homelessness (DH). Methods We used community engaged research and incremental behavioral treatment development to design the Diabetes HOmeless MEdication Support (D-HOMES) program, a one-on-one, 3 month, coaching intervention to improve medication adherence and psychological wellness for DH. We present results of our pilot randomized trial (with baseline, 3 mo., 6 mo. assessments) comparing D-HOMES to enhanced usual care (EUC; brief diabetes education session and routine care; NCT05258630). Participants were English-speaking adults with type 2 diabetes, current/recent (<24 mo.) homelessness, and an HbA1c‗7.5%. We focused on feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement) and acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, CSQ-8). Our primary clinical outcome was glycemic control (HbA1c) and primary behavioral outcome was medication adherence. Secondary outcomes included psychological wellness and diabetes self-care. Results Thirty-six eligible participants enrolled, 18 in each arm. Most participants identified as Black males, had high rates of co-morbidities, and lived in subsidized housing. We retained 100% of participants at 3-months, and 94% at 6-months. Participants reported high satisfaction (mean CSQ-8 scores=28.64 [SD 3.94] of 32). HbA1c reduced to clinically significant levels in both groups, but we found no between group differences. Mean blood pressure improved more in D-HOMES than EUC between baseline and 6 mo. with between group mean differences of systolic -19.5 mmHg (p=0.030) and diastolic blood pressure -11.1 mmHg (p=0.049). We found no significant between group differences in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion We effectively recruited and retained DH over 6 months. Data support that the D-HOMES intervention was acceptable and feasible. We observe preliminary blood pressure improvement favoring D-HOMES that were statistically and clinically significant. D-HOMES warrants testing in a fully powered trial which could inform future high quality behavioral trials to promote health equity.

        "title": "A CASE OF SELF-HARM USING A DEVICE TO STUN FARM ANIMALS",
        "abstract": "There are several types of devices used to stun cattle before slaughter or stunner (captive bolt pistol, cattlegun, stunner). This device consists of a heavy impact rod made of corrosion-resistant alloys such as stainless steel. It is held inside the case with the help of rubber washers and does not protrude from it. The rod is actuated by the trigger and is advanced by compressed air, a spring mechanism, or a blank cartridge charge that is ignited by the firing pin. After a shallow but strong blow to the animal's forehead, the spring tension causes the rod to roll back into the housing. In forensic medical practice, such devices usually appear as instruments of death in cases of suicidal or accidental injuries. Moreover, when reviewing the Ukrainian-language literature, the authors did not come across reports of deaths caused by stunners for stunning animals. Such situations are described in English-language professional periodicals, but they are extremely rare. Killings are generally isolated, apparently due to the fact that fatal wounds when fired from these devices occur from a distance of less than 10 cm, which follows from the design, namely the length of the rod. That is why the authors decided to report on a case from their expert work. \nA 58-year-old man was found unconscious in a beam and was taken to the hospital with a severe open penetrating brain injury, a hole-multifragmentary fracture of the left temporal bone, where he died 10 hours later. No additional data was provided by the police \nAccording to the autopsy data, a wound of a slightly irregular, rounded shape, with a diameter of about 0.9 cm, with small scalloped edges, which were unevenly beveled due to the \"minus-tissue\" defect towards the center, was found. Around the wound, there was an irregular, rectangular-shaped, brown-brown, dried-up scab, which was more pronounced on the lower edge. On the bow of the right temporal bone there is a hole-fragmentary fracture with the formation of a bone defect in the central part. The defect had a rounded shape, its edges are finely serrated, beveled like a trapezoid in the direction of the skull cavity, around the defect there is a funnel-shaped depression of the bone, which is formed by three incomplete fragments of an irregular shape. The total length of the wound canal was about 9 cm, and there were small bone fragments in the brain detritus along its entire length. No striking elements of the projectile or the projectile itself were found within the wound channel. \nAccording to the medical criminalistics investigation, the following were found: intermittent overlays of small dust-like dull particles of dark gray and black color, similar to soot shot, within the sedimentation belt, on the walls of the hole, and on the area of an irregular oval shape, located below and to the right of the above-mentioned damage. A diphenylamine test with dust-like particles gave a positive result. Traces of compounds of iron (characteristic form), lead, nickel and copper were also detected by the contact-diffusion method. \nConclusions: \n \nUnfortunately, police very often do not provide important, and sometimes critically important, information, especially before the examination, so it is necessary to request the provision of criminal proceedings materials in any case with undetermined or unspecified circumstances. \nForensic medical experts must use all available verified sources of information, within the framework allowed by legislation of Ukraine. \nIn this case, the injuries were caused by a device with a firearm mechanism of operation, therefore, in unclear cases, it is necessary to use the term \"device\" and not \"weapon\" in the results. \n",

        "abstract": "Technology is growing rapidly and has affected many aspects of life today. Technology is being used more and more frequently and the most utilized language is English. Tidar English Course provides tutoring for English, but Tidar 7th and 8th grade participants have difficulty in learning and memorizing English vocabulary. To overcome these problems, an application is made to help Tidar 7th and 8th-grade participants learn vocabulary with educational game media. Learning will be packaged into a crossword puzzle game so that it can train their vocabulary by finding the right answer in the crossword puzzle boxes that have been provided. The development method in this research is using Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC), and the testing method uses the User Acceptance Test (UAT). The system testing in this study uses black box testing. User Acceptance Test (UAT) testing submitted to the teacher gets 100% of Tidar 82.44% for grade 7 Tidar participants and 84.22% for grade 8 Tidar participants. It can be concluded that the results of the three User Acceptance Tests (UAT) get the criteria \"Very Feasible\"",

        "abstract": "While homelessness is a global phenomenon, research on homelessness skews heavily towards high-income nations such as those in North America, Europe, and Australia. The academic publishing sector also highly privileges articles written in English. Therefore, homelessness in the global south or non-English as a first language countries is less understood and less recognized. In this article, we explore homelessness as a phenomenon in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. In particular, we use a gender-based analysis to understand the highly gendered nature of homelessness in this region, presenting an argument that while homelessness is gendered globally, in regions where gender inequality is greater, women and gender-diverse people will be more disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Therefore, obtaining Sustainable Development Goal 5 of ‘Gender Equality’ and efforts to prevent homelessness will go hand-in-hand within the MENA region.",

        "abstract": "Background Lack of childcare for children aged 0–3 years has emerged as a global crisis, accentuated by women’s increasing workforce participation and recognition that young children require nurturing care. Through this systematic review, we sought to examine associations between childcare centre attendance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and children’s health, growth, and development, and to generate childcare centre programmatic and research recommendations for children aged 0–3 years. Methods We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane for articles on centre-based childcare for children aged 0–3 years in LMICs, published between 2000 and 2021 in English (or which were translated into English). We excluded articles on specialised subgroups or interventions. We imported the retrieved articles into Covidence for review and assessed them for bias using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool. Results Twenty-two articles (24 studies) met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 36 927 children from 10 countries across Mexico and South America (n = 12), Africa (n = 5), and Asia (n = 5). Outcomes included health (n = 12), growth/nutrition (n = 6), and development (n = 6). Study quality assessments were low; 41% exceeded 50% of quality criteria and 45% adjusted for confounders. Associations between childcare attendance and outcome measures were primarily negative for health (n/N = 7/12) and positive for growth/nutrition (n/N = 5/6) and development (n/N = 4/6). Childcare centre programmatic recommendations for children aged 0–3 years included: age-specific policies; program quality, including safety, hygiene, nutrition, and curriculum; access and affordability; parent engagement; financial support; and workforce development. Research recommendations included: study design, including enrolment age, frequency, duration, childcare type, home and childcare sociodemographic and cultural environments, child and caregiver outcomes, and analytical approaches; longitudinal studies; and implementation research. Conclusions Rigorous primary research in global childcare for young children is urgently needed. Policies, programmes, and investments in high-quality childcare can promote nurturing care for young children, enabling mothers to participate in the workforce.

        "abstract": "Introduction People with chronic conditions and people with colorectal cancer (CRC) may share common risk factors; thus, CRC screening is important for people with chronic conditions. We examined racial and ethnic differences in the use of CRC screening among people with various numbers of chronic conditions. Methods We included data on adult respondents aged 50 to 75 years from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2012 through 2020. We categorized counts of 9 conditions as 0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4. We classified self-reported CRC screening status as up to date or not. We used Poisson models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) among the different counts of chronic conditions in 4 racial and ethnic groups: Hispanic adults with limited English proficiency (LEP), Hispanic adults without LEP, non-Hispanic Black adults, and non-Hispanic White adults. Results Overall, 66.5% of respondents were up to date with CRC screening. The prevalence of being up to date increased with the number of chronic conditions. We found disparities among racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic respondents with LEP had lower rates than non-Hispanic White adults of being up to date with CRC screening across all counts of chronic conditions (APR for 0 conditions = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.64–0.71; APR for ≥4 conditions = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91). Hispanic respondents without LEP with 0, 1, or 2 conditions were less likely than non-Hispanic White respondents to be up to date with CRC screening. We found no significant differences between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White respondents. Conclusion We found disparities among Hispanic BRFSS respondents with LEP, who had lower rates than non-Hispanic White respondents of being up to date with CRC screening, regardless of the number of chronic conditions. Tailored interventions are needed to address these disparities and improve screening rates, particularly among Hispanic people.",

        "abstract": "Linguistic accommodation refers to the process of adjusting one’s language, speech, or communication style to match or adapt to that of others in a social interaction. It is known to be vital to effective health communication. Despite this evidence, there is little scientific guidance on how to design linguistically adapted health behavior interventions for diverse English-speaking populations. This study aims to document the strategies used to develop a culturally grounded cancer prevention intervention with the capabilities to linguistically accommodate to speakers of African American English (AAE). We describe the iterative process of developing a cancer prevention intervention with contributions of racially and linguistically diverse colleagues representing various community and institutional perspectives, including communication scientists, linguists, a community advisory board, professional voice talents, and institutional representatives for scientific integrity. We offer a detailed description of the successes and, in some cases, failures of strategies. Social stereotypes associated with AAE were prevalent at both institutional and community levels, resulting in unanticipated challenges and delays during intervention development. The diversity of linguistic, racial, and role identities within the message development team was integral to successfully addressing and identifying opportunities for process improvement. Language is a vital but often overlooked aspect of intervention development. Message designers should consider implicit social stereotypes that unintentionally shape linguistic choices. This study provides a novel overview of how various types of expertise and iterative message development processes contribute to successfully navigating cultural grounding when sensitive or stigmatized issues are salient.",

        "title": "Experiences and Views of Older Adults of South Asian, Black African, and Caribbean Backgrounds About the Digitalization of Primary Care Services Since the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Focus Group Study",
        "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 prompted governments worldwide to enforce lockdowns and social restrictions, alongside the rapid adoption of digital health and care services. However, there are concerns about the potential exclusion of older adults, who face barriers to digital inclusion, such as age, socioeconomic status, literacy level, and ethnicity. Objective This study aims to explore the experiences of older adults from the 3 largest minoritized ethnic groups in England and Wales—people of South Asian, Black African, and Caribbean backgrounds—in the use of digitalized primary care services since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In total, 27 individuals participated in 4 focus groups (April and May 2023) either in person or via online videoconferencing. Patient and public involvement and engagement were sought through collaboration with community organizations for focus group recruitment and feedback on the topic guide. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Results This paper summarizes the perspectives of 27 older adults from these 3 minoritized ethnic groups and identifies four key themes: (1) service accessibility through digital health (participants faced difficulties accessing digital health care services through online platforms, primarily due to language barriers and limited digital skills, with reliance on younger family members or community organizations for assistance; the lack of digital literacy among older community members was a prominent concern, and digital health care services were felt to be tailored for English speakers, with minimal consultation during the development phase), (2) importance of face-to-face (in-person) appointments for patient-clinician interactions (in-person appointments were strongly preferred, emphasizing the value of physical interaction and connection with health care professionals; video consultations were seen as an acceptable alternative), (3) stressors caused by the shift to remote access (the transition to remote digital access caused stress, fear, and anxiety; participants felt that digital health solutions were imposed without sufficient explanation or consent; and Black African and Caribbean participants reported experiences of racial discrimination within the health care system), and (4) digital solutions (evaluating technology acceptance; participants acknowledged the importance of digitalization but cautioned against viewing it as a one-size-fits-all solution; they advocated for offline alternatives and a hybrid approach, emphasizing the need for choice and a well-staffed clinical workforce). Conclusions Digital health initiatives should address the digital divide, health inequalities, and the specific challenges faced by older adults, particularly those from minoritized ethnic backgrounds, ensuring accessibility, choice, and privacy. Overcoming language barriers involves more than mere translation. Maintaining in-person options for consultations, addressing sensitive issues, and implementing support systems at the practice level to support those struggling to access services are vital. This study recommends that policy makers ensure the inclusivity of older adults from diverse backgrounds in the design and implementation of digital health and social care services.",

        "abstract": "PurposeFood literacy is a multidimensional concept that prioritises the aspects individuals require to navigate the contemporary foodscape successfully. The study aims to map the knowledge base and intellectual structure of the concept of food literacy to assess if the most cited definitions reflect these constructs.Design/methodology/approachThe inclusion criteria of full-text, peer-reviewed articles or conference papers, in English, using “food literacy” within the title, abstract, keywords or linked to the research focus produced 538 articles from the Scopus database from its inception until January 31, 2023. Articles were analysed according to exponential growth, geolocations, authors, articles, research areas and keywords using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and Excel.FindingsFood literacy research grew exponentially between 2012 and 2022 at a rate of 50% and spanned 62 research areas, with nutrition and dietetics being the most common. Vidgen and Gallegos were the most cited authors of the most cited article, and Australia was the most influential food literacy research geolocation. Research originating from developing countries within Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America was underrepresented, and COVID-19 impacted research trends between 2020 and 2023.Practical implicationsIt is recommended to link “food literacy” to appropriate publications to increase its visibility and that food literacy be redefined and conceptualised to better reflect its intellectual structure. To complete this task, further research guided by keyword clustering can enhance conceptual understanding.Originality/valueThis study provides new insight into the knowledge base and intellectual structure of food literacy and provides scope for future research to develop the concept further.",

        "title": "Large Language Models for Mental Health Applications: Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial neural networks trained on extensive datasets to accurately understand and generate natural language. While they have received much attention and demonstrated potential in digital health, their application in mental health, particularly in clinical settings, has generated considerable debate. Objective This systematic review aims to critically assess the use of LLMs in mental health, specifically focusing on their applicability and efficacy in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical settings. By systematically collating and assessing the evidence from current studies, our work analyzes models, methodologies, data sources, and outcomes, thereby highlighting the potential of LLMs in mental health, the challenges they present, and the prospects for their clinical use. Methods Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this review searched 5 open-access databases: MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM Digital Library. Keywords used were (mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry) AND (large language models). This study included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, and excluded articles published in languages other than English. Results In total, 40 articles were evaluated, including 15 (38%) articles on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text analysis, 7 (18%) on the use of LLMs as mental health conversational agents, and 18 (45%) on other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health. LLMs show good effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, destigmatized eHealth services. However, assessments also indicate that the current risks associated with clinical use might surpass their benefits. These risks include inconsistencies in generated text; the production of hallucinations; and the absence of a comprehensive, benchmarked ethical framework. Conclusions This systematic review examines the clinical applications of LLMs in mental health, highlighting their potential and inherent risks. The study identifies several issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of generated content, challenges in interpretability due to the “black box” nature of LLMs, and ongoing ethical dilemmas. These ethical concerns include the absence of a clear, benchmarked ethical framework; data privacy issues; and the potential for overreliance on LLMs by both physicians and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practices. As a result, LLMs should not be considered substitutes for professional mental health services. However, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as valuable clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Since our first pediatric anonymous non-directed live donor liver transplant (A-LDLT) performed in April 2005, 62 children have undergone live donor liver transplant (LDLT) with an anonymous non-directed graft. Anon-LDLT organs being allocated as per our deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) wait list. Aims To evaluate clinical outcomes, recipient characteristics and social determinants of health of pediatric recipients of A-LDLT in comparison to those who received a directed LDLT (Dir-LDLT) and DDLT. Methods Retrospective analysis of all recipients of LDLT performed between January 2005 and March 2023. Demographic and clinical data included age, sex, race, ethnicity, single-parent households, primary diagnosis, recipient blood type, time on waiting list, post-LT intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), time to extubation, and post-transplant comorbidities were assessed as covariates. A comparative analysis was conducted between children receiving A-LDLT, Dir-LDLT versus DDLT. Results A total of 422 (50% male, 57% white, 23% Asian, 7% Black, 5% indigenous) childrenunderwent LT during the study period. Biliary atresia (40%) and metabolic diseases (19%) were the commonest primary indications. A-LDLT was done in 62 children (15%) with no directed donor options. Dir-LDLT was in 174 children (41%). Of 186 DDLTs (44%), 25% were split grafts, 26% reduced, and 49% whole liver grafts. In A-LDLT recipients, the primary diseases were more frequently characterized by metabolic disorders (31%), while the incidence of acute liver failure was notably lower (0%). Recipients of Anon-LDLT were more often Indigenous recipients in comparison to Dir-LDLT or DDLT recipients (p=0.044). Anon-LDLT recipients were more frequently living in single parent households (18% vs 3% vs 10%, pampersand:003C0.001) and to require interpreter assistance (11% vs 3% vs 0.5%, pampersand:003C0.001) (Table), compared to children who received Dir-LDLT or DDLT. Median time on the wait list was longer for Anon-LDLT (92 days) compared to Dir-LDLT (62 days) and DDLT (72 days) recipients (p=0.004). Post-LT ICU LOS, time to extubation, other post-LT complications or patient prognosis were better in the A-LDLT and Dir-LDLT recipients than DDLT recipients. Conclusions This retrospective analysis of 422 children undergoing LT at a single institution confirms excellent patient and graft survival for A-LDLT recipients. Patients from Indigenous communities, single parent and households where English is a second language, are more frequently the beneficiaries of Anon-LDLT grafts. Anon-LDLT, as utilized in this single center analysis, benefits medically underserved pediatric patients who otherwise have limited access to the advantages of LT. Funding Agencies None",

        "abstract": "The Black Lives Matter (BLM) social movement has emerged as a prominent challenge to the principles and values of contemporary societies. Concurrently, the practices of cancel culture extend to the historical past as well. The primary objective of this article is to conduct a comparative analysis of forms of historical forgetting and figures of silence within the commemorative practices of BLM, as depicted in media discourses across the English-speaking countries. Making use of the critical discourse analysis methodology of N. Fairclough and S. Jäger, this study analyzes the discursive aspects of monument cancellations and key figures of silence in the media portrayal of BLM commemorative practices in the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. \nThe research reveals that, despite the unique characteristics of media discourses in Australia and Canada, particularly concerning the memory of indigenous peoples, the canceling practices in the countries examined exhibit similar features. These include general forms of oblivion associated with the formation of a new identity, as outlined by P. Connerton, and the use of forgetting as a weapon, as described by A. Assmann, in the quest for symbolic capital. This study identifies and examines key figures of silence within BLM as a community of memory, including a-historical perspective of colonial era events, disproportionate focus on selected cancellation facts, invocation of collective guilt, silence over morally questionable traits of the oppressed, absence of a constructive program linking past and future, and unchecked emotional expression regarding the past.",

        "abstract": "Passion episodes such as the Buffeting are known for the powerful acts of compassion they occasioned within audiences through their performance of violence on the person of Jesus. Few critics, however, have considered that these episodes depend on antisemitic, Islamophobic, and anti-Black depictions of antagonists when engendering such emotional dispositions. By investigating the dynamics of mockery through a deeper look into the composite identities of Jesus’s antagonists, this study reveals that these plays and the communities that produced them rely on a disingenuous stance of victimhood for their effectiveness. This ‘victim play’—the collaborative community effort to claim the status of victim while simultaneously participating in the victimization of others—obscures that those who are attributed cruel acts of mockery are actually its targets. The powerful rhetorical strategies of the premodern English episodes are thus unearthed in this study.",

        "title": "Care Partner Engagement in Secure Messaging Between Patients With Diabetes and Their Clinicians: Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Background Patient engagement with secure messaging (SM) via digital patient portals has been associated with improved diabetes outcomes, including increased patient satisfaction and better glycemic control. Yet, disparities in SM uptake exist among older patients and racial and ethnic underserved groups. Care partners (family members or friends) may provide a means for mitigating these disparities; however, it remains unclear whether and to what extent care partners might enhance SM use. Objective We aim to examine whether SM use differs among older patients with diabetes based on the involvement of care partner proxies. Methods This is a substudy of the ECLIPPSE (Employing Computational Linguistics to Improve Patient-Provider Secure Emails) project, a cohort study taking place in a large, fully integrated health care delivery system with an established digital patient portal serving over 4 million patients. Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥50 years, newly registered on the patient portal, who sent ≥1 English-language message to their clinician between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Proxy SM was identified by having a registered proxy. To identify nonregistered proxies, a computational linguistics algorithm was applied to detect words and phrases more likely to appear in proxy messages compared to patient-authored messages. The primary outcome was the annual volume of secure messages (sent or received); secondary outcomes were the length of time to the first SM sent by patient or proxy and the number of annual SM exchanges (unique message topics generating ≥1 reply). Results The mean age of the cohort (N=7659) at this study’s start was 61 (SD 7.16) years; 75% (n=5573) were married, 15% (n=1089) identified as Black, 10% (n=747) Chinese, 12% (n=905) Filipino, 13% (n=999) Latino, and 30% (n=2225) White. Further, 49% (n=3782) of patients used a proxy to some extent. Compared to nonproxy users, proxy users were older (P<.001), had lower educational attainment (P<.001), and had more comorbidities (P<.001). Adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, proxy users had greater annual SM volume (20.7, 95% CI 20.2-21.2 vs 10.9, 95% CI 10.7-11.2; P<.001), shorter time to SM initiation (hazard ratio vs nonusers: 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.37; P<.001), and more annual SM exchanges (6.0, 95% CI 5.8-6.1 vs 2.9, 95% CI 2.9-3.0, P<.001). Differences in SM engagement by proxy status were similar across patient levels of education, and racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions Among a cohort of older patients with diabetes, proxy SM involvement was independently associated with earlier initiation and increased intensity of messaging, although it did not appear to mitigate existing disparities in SM. These findings suggest care partners can enhance patient-clinician telecommunication in diabetes care. Future studies should examine the effect of care partners’ SM involvement on diabetes-related quality of care and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Hypertension is the leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality throughout the world and is pervasive in United States emergency departments (ED). This study documents the point prevalence of subclinical heart disease in emergency patients with asymptomatic hypertension. Method This was a prospective observational study of ED patients with asymptomatic hypertension conducted at two urban academic EDs that belong to an eight-hospital healthcare organization in New York. Adult (≥18 years of age) English- or Spanish-speaking patients who had an initial blood pressure (BP) ≥160/100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and second BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, and pending discharge, were invited to participate in the study. We excluded patients with congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation, or who were pregnant, a prisoner, cognitively unable to provide informed consent, or experiencing symptoms of hypertension. We assessed echocardiographic evidence of subclinical heart disease (left ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic and systolic dysfunction). Results A total of 53 patients were included in the study; a majority were young (mean 49.5 years old, [SD 14–52]), self-identified as Black or Other (n = 39; 73.5%), and female (n = 30; 56.6%). Mean initial blood pressure was 172/100 mm Hg, and 24 patients (45.3%) self-reported a history of hypertension. Fifty patients completed an echocardiogram. All (100%) had evidence of subclinical heart disease, with 41 (77.4%) displaying left ventricular hypertrophy and 31 (58.5%) diastolic dysfunction. There was a significant relationship between diastolic dysfunction and female gender [x2 (1, n = 53) = 3.98; P = 0.046]; Black or other race [x2 (3, n = 53) = 9.138; P = 0.03] and Hispanic or other ethnicity [x2 (2, n = 53) = 8.03; P = 0.02]. Less than one third of patients demonstrated systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram, and this was more likely to occur in patients with diabetes mellitus [x2 (1, n = 51) = 4.84; P = 0.02]. Conclusion There is a high probability that Black, Hispanic, and female patients with asymptomatic hypertension are on the continuum for developing overt heart failure. Emergency clinicians should provide individualized care that considers their unique health needs, cultural backgrounds, and social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Background Prevalence of smoking is high among patients receiving care in safety-net settings, and there is a need to better understand patient factors associated with smoking cessation and receipt of cessation services. Objective To identify patient factors associated with smoking cessation attempts and receipt of cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy in a large safety-net health system. Design We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using EHR data in a safety-net system in San Francisco, CA. Participants We included 7384 adult current smokers who had at least three unique primary care encounters with documented smoking status between August 2019 and April 2022. Main measures We assessed four outcomes using multivariate generalized estimating equation models: (1) any cessation attempt, indicating a transition in smoking status from “current smoker” to “former smoker”; (2) sustained cessation, defined as transition in smoking status from current smoker to former smokers for two or more consecutive visits; (3) receipt of smoking cessation counseling from healthcare providers; and (4) receipt of pharmacotherapy. Key Results Of 7384 current adult smokers, 17.6% had made any cessation attempt, and of those 66.5% had sustained cessation. Most patients (81.1%) received counseling and 41.8% received pharmacotherapy. Factors associated with lower odds of any cessation attempt included being aged 45–64, non-Hispanic black, and experiencing homelessness. The factor associated with lower odds of sustained cessation was being male. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving counseling were being insured by Medicaid or being uninsured. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy included speaking languages other than English, being male, and identifying as racial and ethnic minorities. Conclusions Health system interventions could close the gap in access to smoking cessation services for unhoused and racial/ethnic minority patients in safety-net settings, thereby increasing cessation among these populations.",

        "abstract": "\n Using county-level voting data from the 2008 presidential election in New York State, we find evidence that durable cultural factors influence voting behavior. After controlling for contemporaneous socio-economic factors, our econometric models imply that antebellum votes—the 1860 vote for Lincoln and an 1846 referendum on black suffrage—have statistically significant predictive power for the 2008 vote for Barack Obama. Antebellum support for emancipation and the rights of blacks in New York emerged primarily in ‘Yankee’ counties founded by migrants from New England, the descendants of English Puritans. In contrast, so-called ‘Yorker’ counties founded by the Dutch or other groups were less amenable to reforms promoting racial equality. Our estimates indicate that differences in antebellum cultural factors predict an additional Obama vote of 2 − 4% points. This correlation of factors dated some 150 years apart suggests persistence of culture in voting behavior, and the consistency of moral expression in this voting behavior lends support to the ethical voter hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous learning is a fundamental aspect of education that builds important skills, like critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability, which are important for achievement in a constantly changing professional environment. Cultivating it promotes lifelong learning, self-improvement, and knowledge beyond traditional educational settings. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the impact of the investigated autonomous learning approach to learners, and assess their ability to sustain the learning process, hence fostering lifelong learning within the framework of formal education. An Autonomous Learning Model (ALM) based 14-week qualitative study examined learners' work and reflections. Theme-based analysis was conducted with 62 fourth-semester English-language learners. A six-stage thematic analysis discovered coded responses' themes. The ALM examined the following key aspects of individual development: personal responsibility, positive self-esteem, decision-making, problem-solving, interpersonal skills, critical and creative thinking abilities, and a strong enthusiasm for learning. The results showed that autonomous learning is achievable, and that instructors’ support and institutional collaboration will improve new curriculum and courses. This study aims to enhance semester-end evaluations, leading to significant improvements for future language-programed learners and ensuring the sustainability of their learning.",

        "abstract": "Background Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a critical training tool in healthcare, shaping learners’ skills, professional identities, and inclusivity. Leadership demographics in SBME, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialties, influence program design and learner outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms increasingly generate demographic data, but their biases may perpetuate inequities in representation. This study evaluated the demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs generated by three AI platforms—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—across nine global locations. Methods A global cross-sectional study was conducted over 5 days (November 2024). Standardized English prompts were used to generate demographic profiles of simulation instructors and heads of simulation labs from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Outputs included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical specialty data for 2014 instructors and 1880 lab heads. Statistical analyses included ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical data, with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons: P significant < 0.05. Results Significant demographic differences were observed among AI platforms. Claude profiles depicted older heads of simulation labs (mean: 57 years) compared to instructors (mean: 41 years), while ChatGPT and Gemini showed smaller age gaps. Gender representation varied, with ChatGPT and Gemini generating balanced profiles, while Claude showed a male predominance (63.5%) among lab heads. ChatGPT and Gemini outputs reflected greater racial diversity, with up to 24.4% Black and 20.6% Hispanic/Latin representation, while Claude predominantly featured White profiles (47.8%). Specialty preferences also differed, with Claude favoring anesthesiology and surgery, whereas ChatGPT and Gemini offered broader interdisciplinary representation. Conclusions AI-generated demographic profiles of SBME leadership reveal biases that may reinforce inequities in healthcare education. ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrated broader diversity in age, gender, and race, while Claude skewed towards older, White, and male profiles, particularly for leadership roles. Addressing these biases through ethical AI development, enhanced AI literacy, and promoting diverse leadership in SBME are essential to fostering equitable and inclusive training environments.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 14% of the US adult population, yet patient knowledge about kidney disease and engagement in their kidney health is low despite many CKD education programs, awareness campaigns, and clinical practice guidelines. Objective We aimed to examine the impact of the Kidney Score Platform (a patient-facing, risk-based online tool that provides interactive health information tailored to an individual’s CKD risk plus an accompanying clinician-facing Clinical Practice Toolkit) on individual engagement with CKD health and CKD communication between clinicians and patients. Methods We conducted a pre-post intervention study in which English-speaking veterans at risk for CKD in two primary care settings interacted with the Kidney Score platform’s educational modules and their primary care clinicians were encouraged to review the Clinical Practice Toolkit. The impact of the Kidney Score on the Patient Activation Measure (the primary outcome), knowledge about CKD, and communication with their clinician about kidney health was determined with paired t tests. Multivariable linear and logistic models were used to determine whether changes in outcomes after versus before intervention were influenced by age, race or ethnicity, sex, and diabetes status, accounting for baseline values. Results The study population (n=76) had a mean (SD) age of 64.4 (8.2) years, 88% (67/76) was male, and 30.3% (23/76) self-identified as African-American. Approximately 93% (71/76) had hypertension, 36% (27/76) had diabetes, and 9.2% (7/76) had CKD according to the laboratory criteria but without an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition) diagnosis. Patient interaction with the Kidney Score did not change the mean Patient Activation Measure (preintervention: 40.7%, postintervention: 40.2%, P=.23) but increased the mean CKD knowledge score (preintervention: 40.0%, postintervention 51.1%, P<.01), and changed the percentage of veterans who discussed CKD with their clinician (preintervention: 12.3%, postintervention: 31.5%, P<.01). Changes did not differ by age, sex, race, or diabetes status. Results were limited by the small sample size due to low recruitment and minimal clinician engagement with the Clinical Practice Toolkit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions One-time web-based tailored education for patients can increase CKD knowledge and encourage conversations about kidney health. Increasing patient activation for CKD management may require multilevel, longitudinal interventions that facilitate ongoing conversations about kidney health between patients and clinician teams.",

        "abstract": "Background Pregnancy and birth cohort studies are essential for studying the social and biological determinants of human health, yet racial and ethnic minority populations are underrepresented due to low recruitment and retention rates. Remote data collection has potential to improve recruitment of underrepresented populations. The aims of this descriptive qualitative study were to explore the perspectives of pregnant and postpartum women about the barriers and facilitators to enrolling themselves, their child, and their partner in a longitudinal birth cohort study, identify data collection strategies to address barriers, and generate recommendations for future cohort studies. Methods Online focus groups and in-person interviews in English and Spanish were conducted between August and November 2022 with pregnant and postpartum women. Participants were recruited from Black and Hispanic serving obstetric clinics and community-based health and social organizations to ensure a racially and ethnically diverse sample. Analysis was conducted using an inductive thematic approach. Results 60 women participated in 10 focus groups and 11 interviews. Five themes emerged: challenges in committing time and resources to a research study; utility of compensation and resources; fears that research procedures would negatively impact child; concerns regarding data privacy and children's consent; and benefits for their family, community, and society. Black participants voiced concern about historical discrimination in science and mistrust of research, but also wanted to increase Black representation in research for future generations. Spanish-speaking participants expressed hesitancy related to fear of child injury and misuse of data. Women felt their partners would be reluctant to participate, but that incentives such as parental education would be motivating. Participants liked the flexibility of remote data collection in easing logistical challenges to participation but also expressed importance of personal study contact for facilitating access to resources, enhancing trust in the research process, and motivating retention. Participants also expressed the importance of transparency in data collection procedures and communication on study progress. Conclusions Leveraging technological advances in remote data collection may reduce some challenges to recruitment of women and families to birth cohort studies. However, building and maintaining trust among communities with engagement, transparency, and communication is critical for recruitment of underrepresented populations.

        "abstract": "Purpose of Review Despite cervical cancer (CC) being a cancer that can be eliminated, CC disparities persist such that minoritized populations shoulder a disproportionate mortality burden. This may reflect upstream, fundamental drivers of health that impede equitable access to prevention, screening, early detection, and treatment among some groups. This systematic review summarizes evidence on the relationships between structural racism and CC care across the continuum. Recent Findings Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search for peer-reviewed, English-language studies relevant to our research question that were published from 2012–2022 using PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase. Of 8,924 articles identified, 4,383 duplicates were removed, and 4,541 underwent screening, with 206 articles meeting eligibility criteria for inclusion in our data synthesis. Among reviewed studies, 60.2% (n = 124) compared CC outcomes by race and ethnicity, often as proxies for upstream racism. Key findings included evidence of lower CC screening rates among Asian American and Pacific Islander women and higher rates among Black and Hispanic/Latinx women. Barriers to healthcare access and socioeconomic status (SES) factors contributed to delayed follow-up, later-stage CC diagnoses, and poorer outcomes, particularly for Black and Hispanic/Latinx women and those residing in low-SES neighborhoods. Summary This review underscores associations between race, ethnicity, SES, and outcomes across the CC continuum. Most studies examined racial and ethnic disparities in the outcomes of interest rather than directly evaluating measures of structural racism. Future research should refine measures of structural racism to deepen our understanding of its impact on CC across the care continuum.

        "title": "The Discursive Strategies in the Spoken Narratives of Multilingual Sepitori and Sesotho Speakers",
        "abstract": "In linguistically diverse and multilingual South African communities, it is common to use non-standard language varieties (NSLVs), often called mixed languages, as lingua franca. These NSLVs are primarily spoken in black townships throughout South Africa. Previous studies show that the discursive production of oral narratives impacts the development and use of higher-order language processing, as they require the knowledge, language skills and abilities to produce coherent discourse. The main focus of the existing literature in oral narrative is mostly on standard languages. In this study, we explore how speakers of Sepitori, a non-standard language variety (NSLV), produce an oral narrative compared to Sesotho, a standard language. The current study investigates the oral narrative production of a total number of 20 participants who are adult speakers of Sesotho and Sepitori (ten from each language). The Sesotho speakers were bilingual speakers of English and Sesotho. The Sepitori speakers were multilingual speakers of English, Sesotho, Zulu and other languages spoken in the Mamelodi township. This study used a mixed methodology of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Narratives were annotated for language complexity in the macro- and microstructure elements: the length and type of clause, pragmatic acts, referential lexical choices and code-switched words. Sepitori speakers produced narratives characterised by interactive clauses unrelated to the narrative level and with a greater range of lexical referents, showcasing more individual linguistic variation. Sesotho speakers produced a more sequential oral narrative in line with story schema with fewer interjections to the researcher. In an increasingly linguistically heterogeneous South Africa, more research is required to gain insights into how multilingual individuals develop and refine their narrative skills, emphasising the much-needed focus on NSLV from a psycholinguistic perspective, which may ultimately inform tools of assessment for multilingual children and adults in social, clinical and academic contexts.",

        "abstract": "This article addresses bias in Spoken Language Systems (SLS) that involve both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and reports experiments to improve the performance of SLS for automated language and literacy‐related assessments with students who are under served in the U.S. educational system. We frame bias in SLS in terms of testing fairness and validity, stemming in part from the exclusion of sufficiently large training datasets in varieties of English other than General American English (GAE). We adopt an Interpretation/Use Argument approach to validity focused on clarity of constructs and scoring accuracy. While SLS use ASR to automatically transcribe students’ utterances, and apply NLP algorithms to ASR transcripts to measure students’ speech samples, it is well‐documented in studies with adults that ASR is typically more problematic for African American English (AAE) speakers than for other groups due to differences in prosody, pronunciation, word usage, and grammar. We utilized child speech and text corpora to improve algorithms that score oral task responses for child AAE speakers and, in some experiments, children with oral language and reading difficulties. Favorable results provide impetus and possible solutions for fair and inclusive assessments for diverse student groups in the future.",

        "abstract": "Background People with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS; sometimes referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome) experience poor health-related quality of life and only rarely recover. ME/CFS has no curative treatment, and no single diagnostic test. Public health and policy decisions relevant to ME/CFS require knowledge of its prevalence and barriers to diagnosis. However, people with ME/CFS report lengthy diagnostic delays and prevalence estimates vary greatly due to uneven diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Factors that influence diagnosis could be revealed by stratifying a single population by gender, age and ethnicity. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics data, routinely collected by the NHS in England, was downloaded from the Feasibility Self-Service of NHS DigiTrials. This was used to stratify individuals with the ICD-10 code that best reflects ME/CFS symptoms (G93.3) according to age, self-reported gender and ethnicity, General Practice and NHS England Integrated Care Board (ICB). Results In all, 100,055 people in England had been diagnosed with ME/CFS (ICD-10:G93.3) between April 1 1989 and October 7 2023, 0.16% of all registered patients. Of these, 79,445 were females and 20,590 males, a female-to-male ratio of 3.88:1. Female relative to male prevalence peaked at about 6-to-1 in individuals’ fourth and fifth decades of life. Prevalence varied widely across the 42 ICBs: 0.086%-0.82% for females and 0.024%-0.21% for males. White individuals were approximately fivefold more likely to be diagnosed with ME/CFS than others; Black, Asian or Chinese ethnicities are associated with particularly low rates of ME/CFS diagnoses. This ethnicity bias is stronger than for other common diseases. Among active English GP practices, 176 (3%) had no registered ME/CFS patients. Eight ICBs (19%) each contained fewer than 8 other-than-white individuals with a G93.3 code despite their registers containing a total of 293,770 other-than-white patients. Conclusion Other-than-white ethnic groups, older females (> 60y), older males (> 80y), and people living in areas of multiple deprivation are disproportionately undiagnosed with ME/CFS. Lifetime prevalence of ME/CFS for English females and males may be as high as 0.92% and 0.25%, respectively, or approximately 404,000 UK individuals overall (0.6%). This improved estimate of ME/CFS prevalence allows more accurate assessment of the socioeconomic and disease burden imposed by ME/CFS.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAs European healthcare systems struggle with increasing workload and sustainability issues, it is estimated that 20% of their production is ineffective. One potential strategy to reduce this excess is by minimizing the use of unnecessary laboratory tests. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of presenting physicians in Europe with the cost of laboratory tests at the time of ordering on the quantities and expense of laboratory tests as well as to identify knowledge gaps on this matter.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was conducted in February 2025. Studies were included if written in English and conducted in Europe. There were no restrictions on year of publication. Study quality was evaluated using a modified Downs and Black checklist.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 2185 publications identified, five met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were published 2002-2021 and found a reduction in order cost and/or volume of laboratory test, following price display (four with statistically significant results). The reduction in order costs were greater than the reduction in order volume. Additionally, the impact of price display diminished over time as the intervention period continued. None of the studies included patient safety measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrice display is a simple yet potentially impactful intervention as it is likely to reduce both the cost and volume of tests, thereby decreasing the workload and enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine if price display is a patient-safe intervention.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare holds transformative potential but faces critical challenges in ethical accountability and systemic inequities. Biases in AI models, such as lower diagnosis rates for Black women or gender stereotyping in Large Language Models, highlight the urgent need to address historical and structural inequalities in data and development processes. Disparities in clinical trials and datasets, often skewed toward high-income, English-speaking regions, amplify these issues. Moreover, the underrepresentation of marginalized groups among AI developers and researchers exacerbates these challenges. To ensure equitable AI, diverse data collection, federated data-sharing frameworks, and bias-correction techniques are essential. Structural initiatives, such as fairness audits, transparent AI model development processes, and early registration of clinical AI models, alongside inclusive global collaborations like TRAIN-Europe and CHAI, can drive responsible AI adoption. Prioritizing diversity in datasets and among developers and researchers, as well as implementing transparent governance will foster AI systems that uphold ethical principles and deliver equitable healthcare outcomes globally.",

        "abstract": "A cross-sectional study was conducted with Brazilian adults from the 2019 Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde (PNS 2019; National Health Survey, in English) who self-declared race/skin color white or black (n = 87,187), to investigate racial inequality in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression. Symptom-based depression was screened using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff ≥ 10), while medical diagnosis was self-reported. Prevalence of agreement (presence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) and disagreement (absence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) were compared according to race/skin color. The Odds Ratio (OR) for the association between both depression indicators and race/skin color were estimated by Logistic regression adjusted by socioeconomic variables. The black population had a higher prevalence of symptom-based depression than medical diagnosis (11.0% versus 8.6%; 2.5 percentual points (pp)), with greater differences among younger adults (6.0 pp), without a partner (3.6 pp), with lower income (3.9 pp), education (3.0 pp), less developed regions (north: 3.6 pp; northeast: 4.2 pp) and those with recent access to medical care (4.5 pp). The white population had a higher prevalence of medical diagnosis than symptom-based depression (10.6% versus 12.5%; -1.9 pp), with greater differences between those with higher income (-7.4 pp), education (-4.5 pp) and from south region (-6.0 pp). Disagreement was higher among black individuals while agreement was higher among white, with significant inequality among women for both agreement (33.5% in black versus 41.7% in white) and disagreement (66.5% in black versus 58.3% in white). The black population had a lower chance of having medical diagnosis of depression (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.70-0.84) than white, regardless of socioeconomic variables. Racial inequality was identified in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression, with greater inequality among women and those with lower income and education.",

        "abstract": "\n In this study, we examined the relation between social perspective taking and writing quality among secondary school students in the United States. The participants included 214 middle and high school students (116 females), with a diverse demographic composition: 71.5% Hispanic, 10% White, 7% Pacific Islander, 5.6% Asian American, 2% African American, and 0.5% Native American. Students were asked to write an argumentative text after reading sources related to a historical topic in history class, and the quality of their essays was rated. Their social perspective taking was measured using a scenario-based assessment where students were presented with scenarios with social conflicts and provided open-ended responses related to various perspectives. These responses were coded based on their articulation, simple, and complex positioning. Structural equation modeling revealed that female students, although marginally significant, tended to have higher levels of social perspective taking compared to their male counterparts after controlling for English learner status, race/ethnicity, poverty status, and grade level. Additionally, perspective taking was positively related to the quality of argumentative writing after controlling for student demographic backgrounds. Future research should explore various dimensions of perspective taking and their impacts on writing in different genres to enhance our understanding of the relation between perspective taking and writing.",

        "title": "Unraveling the reality of interpersonal violence against children and adolescents in Brazil: a systematic review",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to review scientific publications on reports of violence against children and adolescents in Brazil from 2018 to 2022 based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. Selection encompassed quantitative and qualitative studies published in Portuguese, English, and Spanish from the PubMed Central, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Two trilingual reviewers analyzed the studies according to the eligibility criteria, and the quality of the studies was assessed using the Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The 21 eligible studies were then analyzed, and the social determinants of health listed were grouped into categories (territory, race/ethnicity, gender, age, type of violence, drugs, perpetrator, and where the act occurred) to create a narrative synthesis about each one. The results show worrisome patterns of ethnic-racial inequalities regarding violence, pointing towards a greater vulnerability of the black population. Analyses based on gender, age, and type of violence also reveal a particular vulnerability of girls, especially regarding sexual violence. The perpetrators were mainly identified as the victims’ fathers and mothers, highlighting the relevance of the family setting in enabling violent acts and showing the need for interventions focused on this context. The underreporting of cases indicates the importance of improving report mechanisms and raising community awareness to ensure that the reality of violence against children and adolescents is presented accurately.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Wisconsin, with higher rates in Black/African American (Black) and Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) populations. In partnership with Milwaukee Recreation (MKE Rec), Total Wellness (TW) was created to provide lifestyle and cancer prevention programming to local communities. Program feasibility, potential efficacy, and sustainability were evaluated. TW is a 16-week program integrated into MKE Rec and implemented over two 8-week sessions led by instructors trained in lifestyle change and cancer prevention. TW was evaluated at the individual and systems level. Class registrants were invited to participate in the evaluation, which included surveys and a physical assessment. Sixty participants consented to the program evaluation: 58.3% self-identified as Black and 7.3% as Hispanic. Survey results indicated significant improvements in cancer knowledge, self-reported diet, and physical activity. Physical assessment showed significant improvements in weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and fitness. System-wise, three MKE Rec instructors were trained, and classes operated out of two sites, serving a predominantly Black neighborhood and a large Hispanic population. English-taught sessions of TW showed successful integration into MKE Rec programming throughout 2 years. Spanish-language only classes were attempted but did not meet minimum enrollment to proceed. TW showed success in improving individual cancer awareness and healthy lifestyle changes. TW was also integrated into MKE Rec and showed sustained success in reaching Black communities with limited reach in Hispanic communities. This program demonstrates the potential for a community health intervention program to address cancer disparities.",

        "abstract": "Background Data science approaches have been pivotal in addressing public health challenges. However, there has been limited focus on identifying essential data science skills for health researchers, gaps in capacity building provision, barriers to access, and potential solutions. Objectives This review aims to identify essential data science skills for health researchers and key stakeholders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as well as to explore gaps and barriers in data science capacity building and share potential solutions, including any regional variations. Methods An online survey was conducted in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, gathering both quantitative and qualitative responses. Descriptive analysis was performed in R V4.3, and a thematic workshop approach facilitated qualitative analysis. Findings From 262 responses from individuals across 54 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), representing various institutions and roles, we summarised essential data science skills globally and by region. Thematic analysis revealed key gaps and barriers in capacity building, including limited training resources, lack of mentoring, challenges with data quality, infrastructure and privacy issues, and the absence of a conducive research environment. Conclusion and future directions Respondents’ consensus on essential data science skills suggests the need for a standardised framework for capacity building, adaptable to regional contexts. Greater investment, coupled with expanded collaboration and networking, would help address gaps and barriers, fostering a robust data science ecosystem and advancing insights into global health challenges.",

        "abstract": "Objectives/Goals: To create raciolinguistically sensitive emotion recognition assessment materials, we will (i) identify the prosodic cues that signal differences between raciolects (Black vs. White American English) and (ii) identify the prosodic cues that signal different emotions (angry, happy, and sad). Methods/Study Population: Research evaluating prosodic differences between raciolects and emotions both implicate pitch. For example, Black speakers tend to produce speech lower in pitch, and sad speech tends to be narrower in pitch range. In our study, 50 Black and 50 White American healthy adults will hear manipulated recordings of Black and White speakers uttering pseudoword strings that vary by mean pitch and pitch range. In the race task, participants will choose whether the stimulus was produced by a Black or White speaker. In the emotion task, they will choose whether the stimulus sounded happy, angry, or sad. Linear mixed-effects models will be used to determine the pitch correlates for each emotion by race. Results/Anticipated Results: If mean pitch (high, low) and pitch range (wide, narrow) function as acoustic correlates for emotions but differ by race, we expect the following: first, members in each participant group (Black, White) will converge on correlates that differentiate emotions and race; and second, the emotion correlates will differ between groups. Preliminary results using stimuli from only White speakers suggest convergence across groups for emotions (angry: low mean pitch, happy: high mean pitch, and sad: narrow pitch range) but not race. Ongoing data collection including stimuli from White and Black speakers will be used to conduct planned comparisons as well as test same-race, different-race differences. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Characterizing the prosodic differences in emotion recognition between races helps us understand disparities in post-stroke aprosodia. Additionally, developing a linguistically informed strategy for assessing deficits between dialects can be readily implemented across diverse linguistic communities.",

        "abstract": "Idioms are non-compositional expressions whose meanings transcend the literal interpretation of their components (e.g., “break the ice”). They highlight the psycholinguistic tension between direct retrieval and compositional semantic analysis. Past research suggests L1 readers rely more on direct retrieval and idiom familiarity, while L2 readers depend more on word-by-word compositional processing. Supporting this, studies show that disrupting an idiom’s canonical form impacts L1 readers more than L2 readers. This study explored the reverse effect by strengthening an idiom’s canonical form through font color. L1 and L2 readers read English sentences containing idiomatic/literal phrases, presented in colored/standard font, and judged whether the phrases made sense. Accuracy and reaction times were recorded. In L1 readers, idiom superiority (i.e., better performance for idioms than literal phrases) was driven by familiarity, with color coding enhancing this effect for more familiar idioms. In L2 readers, idiom superiority was influenced by both familiarity and decomposability, with color coding amplifying both effects. These findings suggest that L1 readers primarily rely on direct retrieval, whereas L2 readers utilize both direct retrieval and compositional processing, with color coding aiding idiomatic processing for both groups.",

        "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 public health emergency catalyzed widespread adoption of both video- and audio-only telemedicine visits. This proliferation highlighted inequities in use by age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language. Few studies have investigated how differences in health system telemedicine implementation affected these inequities. Objective This study aims to describe patients who used telemedicine during the public health emergency and identify predictors of telemedicine use across 2 health systems with different telemedicine implementations. Methods This retrospective cohort study included adults with diabetes receiving primary care between July 2020 and March 2021 at 2 independent health systems in San Francisco, California. Participant sociodemographic characteristics, health information, and telemedicine utilization were acquired from electronic health records. The primary outcome was visit type (any audio or video telemedicine vs in-person only) during the study period. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between visit type and key predictors associated with digital exclusion (age, race and ethnicity, preferred language, and neighborhood socioeconomic status), adjusting for baseline health. We included an interaction term to evaluate health system impact on each predictor and then stratified by health system (academic, which prioritized video-enabled visits, vs safety net, which prioritized audio-only visits). Results Among 10,201 patients, we found higher odds of telemedicine use in the safety net system compared with the academic system (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.94, 95% CI 2.48-3.48). Patients with younger age (18-34 years: aOR 2.55, 95% CI 1.63-3.97; 35-49 years: aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.73 vs 75+ years) and Chinese-language preference (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.66-2.5 vs English) had higher odds of having a telemedicine visit. Non-Hispanic Asian (aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.79), non-Hispanic Black (aOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68-1), and Hispanic or Latine (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95) patients had lower odds of having a telemedicine visit than non-Hispanic White patients. We found significant interactions between health system and age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language (P<.05). After stratifying by health system, several differences persisted in the academic system: non-Hispanic Asian (aOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.70) and Latine (aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) patients had lower odds of a telemedicine visit, and younger age groups had higher odds (18-34 years: aOR 3.97, 95% CI 1.99-7.93; 35-49 years: aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.36-2.56). In the safety net system, Chinese-speaking patients had higher odds of having a telemedicine visit (aOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.85-3.42). Conclusions We found disparities in telemedicine utilization by age, race and ethnicity, and preferred language, primarily in the health system that used more video visits. While telemedicine expanded rapidly recently, certain populations remain at risk for digital exclusion. These findings suggest that system-level factors influence telemedicine adoption and implementation decisions impact accessibility for populations at risk for digital exclusion.",

        "abstract": "We quantify the representation, or presence, of characters of color in English Language Arts (ELA) instruction in the United States to better understand possible racial/ethnic emphases and gaps in literary curricula. We contribute two datasets: the first consists of books listed in widely-adopted Advanced Placement (AP) Literature & Composition exams, and the second is a set of books taught by teachers surveyed from schools with substantial Black and Hispanic student populations. In addition to these book lists, we provide an unprecedented collection of hand-annotated sociodemographic labels of not only literary authors, but also their characters. We use computational methods to measure all main characters’ presence through three distinct and nuanced metrics: frequency, narrative perspective, and burstiness. Our annotations and measurements show that the sociodemographic composition of characters in books recommended by AP Literature has not shifted much for over twenty years. As a case study of how ELA curricula may deviate from the curricula prescribed by AP, our teacher-provided sample shows a greater emphasis on books featuring first-person, primary characters of color. We also find that only a few books in either dataset feature both White main characters and main characters of color. Arguably, these books may uphold a view of racial/ethnic segregation as a societal norm.",

        "abstract": "This article examines Ernest J. Gaines' The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1972) as a parody and critique of dominant cultural narratives. Combining close reading with biographical criticism, which contextualizes the novel through Gaines’ socio-cultural background as an African American author. Drawing on Bakhtin’s and Hannoosh’s theories of parody and Gates’ concept of chiasmus, the analysis explores how the novel imitates, transforms, and subverts its targets. Bhabha’s notion of mimicry situates parody within postcolonial discourse, while Genette’s theory of frequency analyzes the novel’s repetitive narrative structures. Ashcroft, Griffiths, and Tiffin’s concepts of appropriation and abrogation address Gaines’ use of English, shaped by his identity as a Black writer from Louisiana and his California education. Bakhtin’s heteroglossia highlights the novel’s polyphonic structure, reflecting its diverse voices. Ong’s theories of orality and literacy contrast Louisiana’s oral traditions with Gaines’ literary techniques. Interviews with Gaudet and Wooton reveal the influence of white literary traditions on Gaines, situating him within African American literary frameworks. Loomba’s critique of colonial discourse positions the novel as a subversive response to white supremacy. Thus, the objective of this study is to demonstrate that Gaines uses parody in the Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman as both a literary form and an ideological tool to challenge hegemonic narratives and amplify African American voices.",

        "abstract": "Effective communication is crucial in reducing health disparities. However, linguistic differences, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE), can lead to communication gaps between patients and physicians, negatively affecting care and outcomes. This study examines whether large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Llama 3.3, can replicate AAVE in simulated clinical dialogues to improve cultural sensitivity. We tested four prompt types—BaseP, DemoP, LingP, and CompP—using United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) case simulations. Statistical analyses on the models’ outputs showed a significant difference among prompt types for both GPT-4 (F(2,70) = 6.218, p = 0.003) and Llama 3.3 (F(2,70) = 12.124, p < 0.001), indicating that including demographic information and/or explicit AAVE cues influences each model’s output. Combining demographic and linguistic cues (CompP) yielded the highest mean AAVE feature counts (e.g., 9.83 for GPT-4 vs. 16.06 for Llama 3.3), although neither model fully captured the diversity of AAVE. Moreover, simply mentioning African American demographics triggers extra informal forms, suggesting built-in stereotypes or biases in both models. Overall, these findings highlight the promise of LLMs for culturally sensitive healthcare communication, while underscoring the need for continued refinement to address stereotypes and more accurately represent diverse linguistic styles.

        "abstract": "Abstract Amidst resurging syphilis infection rates, increasing efforts are being made towards development of a syphilis vaccine. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators of syphilis vaccine trial participation among priority groups for early phase studies. We conducted interviews with English-speaking individuals ≥18 years old recruited from an infectious disease clinic, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing site, an online research bulletin board, and HIV community advisory boards in North Carolina from April 2021–June 2022. Eligibility criteria included STI diagnosis within 12 months, people living with HIV (PLWH), men who have sex with men, or persons engaged in transactional sex. The interview guide examined views on syphilis vaccines, trial participation, and community engagement. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analysed for emergent themes using a social ecological model. Thirty individuals were interviewed, including eight (27%) women, 13 (43%) Black/African American individuals, and 19 (63%) PLWH. While 19 (63%) interviewees were interested in syphilis vaccine trial participation, 10 (33%) noted participation would depend on trial parameters; one person expressed no interest. Trial participation barriers included physical risks, time commitments, and concerns related to mistrust and mistreatment. Facilitators included advancing science, syphilis prevention, and trusting the researchers. Interviewees emphasized the importance of community involvement to inform vaccine trials, particularly amidst the lingering shadow of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. While priority groups thus expressed interest in syphilis vaccine trial participation, tailored community engagement will be essential prior to clinical trials. Additional mixed methods research is urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "Translating pun discourse comparatively across languages and cultures is an arduous and challenging task that involves a more than competent level of language proficiency and dexterity. It demands advanced knowledge and apprehension of the cultural origin, social setting, and sociocultural context of the source language and translated language. This study explores cultural conceptualizations as a literary translation strategy in Arabic culture-specific pun discourse found in the poetry of the Saudi poet Ghazi Al-Gosaibi, translated into English. The study uses a descriptive qualitative approach to investigate the selected Arabic pun discourse in two poems, “Love… and the Black Ports” and “Song in a Tropical Night.” The study also suggests a literary translation strategy for rendering culture-specific puns into English cultural conceptualizations. The utmost significance of this study is how cultural conceptualizations, such as patterns, types, and social allegory, play a pivotal role in translating culture-specific puns. Results show that the translators, Sargon Boulus and Joon-Stubbs, are accurate and faithful to the original wording of the Arabic culture-specific puns in the two poems. The study found that the translators use several different translation strategies, such as literal translations and faithful translations. The study reveals that utilizing cultural conceptualizations as a literary translation strategy plays a central role in rendering Arabic culture-specific puns that lead to bridging communication gaps and minimizing the cultural gap. Such utilization helps translators adequately render puns among various cultural and language boundaries. Some significant implications and recommendations are offered.",

        "abstract": "\n Cliffed (and rocky) coasts are geomorphic features occurring in about 80% of the coastline of the world and are strongly influenced by a broad range of both natural and anthropogenic processes that may cause serious erosion problems. Since the sea wave motion is a fundamental driver of cliff erosion, the cliffs become sensitive to increasing of global sea levels and to extreme weather events, which are both associated with global warming. Because of its importance, a considerable amount of investigations on coastal cliff erosion (CCE) were reported during the last decades. A bibliometric analysis is an useful tool to identify patterns of a given theme from a large body of academic literature. There is no previous evidence of a global bibliometric analysis in the literature in English on themes of CCE. Therefore, the aim of this article was to carry out a bibliometric analysis from Scopus database of CCE for the period 2000–2023. Once obtained, two filtering steps for selection of documents consisting of a custom R script implementation and a careful reading of the remaining documents were applied. During the search, a dynamic approach that puts emphasis on the processes operating on rocky coasts was selected instead of an evolutionary geological perspective. The final list reached 583 documents. A second aim was to discuss the research trends and challenges based on the latest highly-cited documents. As main result, the trend of the scientific production in the theme of CCE had an increasing interest over the last years, with an average compound annual growth rate of 15.6%. On the other side, the results demonstrated that even though the USA took the second place, European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain and Poland) lead the ranking; therefore, there is a scarcity of knowledge about the theme in large regions such as South America and Africa where seacliffs are dominants.",

        "abstract": "Background: Early childhood sun exposure contributes to lifetime risk of skin cancer. Many individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds believe their skin tone confers immunity to sun damage; however, evidence of negative outcomes exists. Best practice in photoprotection for children of color is unclear. Objective: We sought to address the risks, benefits, and needs for sun protection and education in children of color. Methods: An English-language systematic literature review was conducted. Inclusion criteria were data on children of color and content relevant to photodamage and photoprotection. Results: Photoprotection is needed for children of all skin tones with photosensitivity. Individuals with darker skin tones have more innate photoprotection compared with lighter skin tone individuals, but both have incomplete photoprotection. Risk of nevus formation, skin cancer, and dyspigmentation are universal with varying degrees. Hispanic and Black communities are less likely to practice sun protection. Studies demonstrate need for early, culturally appropriate education about sun exposure in all communities. Limitations: Studies reviewed were of varied design and populations. Conclusion: This review determined that photoprotection has benefits for all patients, and the benefits of photoprotection should be taught early to children, caregivers, and parents of all skin tones using culturally appropriate approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Pre-operative anxiety (POA) in pediatric burn patients poses a challenge for recovery, as management of burn injuries often requires multiple surgical interventions over time. With an occurrence rate between 50-75%, early identification of POA is essential to prevent and mitigate long-term psychiatric and behavioral concerns. Upon evaluation, our facility process lacked a mechanism to identify anxious patients, develop treatment plans, communicate information or provide feedback on anxiety management. To address these concerns a uniform workflow was needed. This project was undertaken as a Quality Improvement Initiative and was not formally supervised by an Institutional Review Board. Methods A multi-disciplinary workgroup evaluated processes and generated solutions. Four high-value touch points were identified offering opportunities for improvement in case management, child life, nurse practitioner and operating room (OR) roles. Key elements include prescreening, historical response to induction, anxiety-specific documentation, and inclusion of an OR huddle. (Figure 1) Optimized process was implemented on 04/01/24. Patients identified through prescreen process from 04/01/24-09/13/24 as having POA were included. Descriptive statistics and McNemar’s test for ordinal data were used to compare documentation of POA and if anxiolytics were offered between initial and most recent outpatient surgical encounters. Results A total of 55 patients with a mean burn size of 28% total body surface area and age of 2.7 years were identified as having POA. About 78.5% were injured before age 5, with 59% of patients having acute admission over 4 weeks and an average of 16.13 surgeries. Of these, 51.8% were white/non-Hispanic, 35.7% Hispanic, 8.9% Asian, and 1.8% African American; 49.1% received initial care in another country, and 47.3% were non-English speakers. There was a significant increase in provision of pre-op anxiolytics between first and last outpatient surgical encounters (8 vs 41; p=0.001). Similarly, documentation of POA plan in the history and physical increased from 13 to 47 patient records (p = 0.001). POA listed in patient problem list also significantly increased (7 vs 18; p=0.005). Conclusions Capturing patients’ POA improved post-implementation of new workflow. Multidisciplinary communication was a key component of success, but continued challenges exist. Reliable documentation within the medical record as well as engagement from all multidisciplinary members is crucial for efficiency. Applicability of Research to Practice Further research including guardian perspective on POA intervention is necessary. Funding for the Study N/A",

        "title": "Molecular Epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae Serotype 1: A Systematic Review of Circulating Clones and Clonal Clusters",
        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 is one of the most prevalent serotypes commonly associated with invasive pneumococcal disease cases and outbreaks worldwide. Several sequence types of this serotype have been identified globally, including those exhibiting both high virulence potential and antimicrobial resistance profiles. This systematic review presents the global distribution of clones of pneumococcal serotype 1, describing their circulating patterns in various regions in the world. A database search was conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using keywords related to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1. The inclusion criteria entailed peer-reviewed studies published in English describing the utilization of at least one molecular genotyping tool to identify S. pneumoniae serotype 1 clones based on their sequence types. Data extracted were managed and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 365 (Version 2108). Forty-three studies were finally included in the systematic review. A total of 103 MLST serotype 1 sequence types were identified in 48 countries. These clones were widely reported to be associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases. Globally, ST217 and ST306 clonal complexes (CC217 and CC306) were the predominant lineages of serotype 1 sequence types, exhibiting distinct continental distribution patterns. CC217, characterized by ST217, ST303, ST612, ST618, and ST3081, was predominant in Africa and Asia. ST306 clonal complex, which is grouped into ST306, ST304, and ST227 were mostly found in Europe, Oceania, North America, and some countries in South America. ST615 was predominant in Chile, Peru, and Argentina. The hypervirulence nature of serotype 1, coupled with its complex genetic diversity, poses a significant public health threat. Our findings emphasize the need for enhanced surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of these hypervirulent clones, ultimately informing evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control.",

        "abstract": "Background Health inequalities exist globally, but limited data exist on this topic for bacteraemia. Aim In this study we investigated health inequalities surrounding bacteraemia in England, to identify high-risk population groups and areas of intervention. Methods We retrospectively analysed English surveillance data between 2018 and 2022 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and both meticillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA) bacteraemia. Crude incidence rates stratified by index of multiple deprivation and ethnic groups were calculated; age-adjusted rate ratios were estimated using negative binomial regression models. Results We identified 342,787 bacteraemia cases. Across all pathogens, as the level of deprivation rose, so did the age-adjusted bacteraemia incidence rate ratio. Compared with residents of the 20% least deprived areas of England, residents of the 20% most deprived areas had a 2.68-fold increased bacteraemia rate for MRSA (95% CI: 2.29–3.13) and 1.95-fold for E. coli (95% CI: 1.84–2.05), and 15% higher odds of dying within 30 days of any bacteraemia (95% CI: 1.13–1.19). After age adjustment, the incidence of all bacteraemia was higher in the Asian and Black groups compared with the White group: for MRSA, 79% higher in the Asian (95% CI: 1.51–2.10) and 59% higher in the Black (95% CI: 1.29–1.95) groups. The exception was MSSA, whose incidence was highest in the White group. Conclusion Disproportionately higher age-adjusted incidence of bacteraemia occurred in deprived areas and ethnic minorities. These disparities are likely multifactorial, possibly including socioeconomic, cultural, and systemic risk factors and different burden of comorbidities. Better understanding these factors can enable targeted interventions.",

        "title": "Health Literacy and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Scores Among Patients Referred to Spine Surgeons",
        "abstract": "Background Health literacy is “the degree to which individuals can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.\" Low health literacy is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as increased risk and length of hospitalization after abdominal surgery. However, the impact of health literacy on outcomes in the spine surgery patient population is understudied. This study seeks to evaluate the relationship between patients' health literacy scores and various outcomes, primarily a patient's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) score at their baseline visit with a spine surgeon. A greater understanding of the impact of health literacy on health outcomes may improve treatment for patients with lower health literacy. Methods This is a single-center retrospective study at New York University (NYU) Langone Orthopedic Center. A health literacy measurement survey (i.e., the Newest Vital Sign survey) was administered to English-speaking adult patients aged 18 years and older who presented to two attending spine surgeons between June 1, 2022, and August 15, 2022, as new or follow-up patients. The survey consists of six questions, and patients were categorized into two different health literacy levels based on the number of correct responses. A score of 0-3 suggests limited literacy, and a score of 4-6 indicates adequate literacy. Additional data collected include PROMIS at the patient’s baseline appointment with the surgeon to create consistency between new and follow-up patients. Key demographic and clinical data were also collected. Univariate associations between health literacy and PROMIS scores were investigated using the Welch Two Sample t-test and Pearson's Chi-squared test. A multivariate analysis was carried out implementing a binary logistic regression model. Results This study included 57 patients with an average age of 57 years, 29 (51%) of whom identified as female. The racial breakdown of this cohort was 33 (58%) White, 11 (19%) Black, 5 (9%) Asian, and 5 (9%) Hispanic. The health literacy survey results demonstrated that 25 (44%) had limited health literacy, and 32 (56%) had adequate health literacy. Limited literacy patients were older (mean age of 62 years for Limited vs. 54 years for Adequate, P=0.024) and more likely to be patients of color (either Asian, Black, or Hispanic) (15 (60%) Limited vs. 6 (19%) Adequate, P = 0.002). Limited literacy patients also, on average, had a lower self-reported physical health score (36.6 for Limited vs. 41.2 for Adequate, P=0.050) and were more likely to have hypertension (20 (80%) Limited vs. 10 (31%) Adequate, P<0.001). A logistic regression model yielded an odds ratio of 1.16 between patient-reported physical health and health literacy, indicating that the odds of having adequate health literacy increase by about 16% for each unit increase in the Physical Health score. A Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test was used and demonstrated minimal multicollinearity among the variables in the logistic regression. Conclusion This study shows that health literacy plays a significant role in health outcomes, especially in chronic health conditions like physical health for spine surgery patients and hypertension. These results align with the literature, showing how lower health literacy correlates with worse physical health scores and a greater incidence of hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Background: Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is a prevalent condition among overhead athletes, often managed through therapeutic exercise interventions. However, the quality of reporting in exercise protocols significantly impacts their reproducibility and clinical implementation. The Consensus for Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) provides a standardized framework to assess the quality of exercise reporting in clinical research. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the quality of exercise protocols used to treat SIS in overhead athletes by applying the CERT checklist. Additionally, the risk of bias was assessed to determine the methodological rigor of included studies. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Sport Discuss, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched for eligible studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series that investigated exercise therapy for SIS in overhead athletes. Studies had to be published in English and provide details on exercise interventions. Exclusion criteria included non-human studies, acute injuries, and postoperative management. The primary outcome was the quality of intervention reporting, assessed using the CERT checklist. The secondary outcome was the risk of bias, evaluated using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Results: Five studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising four RCTs and one case series. CERT scores ranged from 6 to 13 (median = 8, IQR = 1), indicating suboptimal reporting quality. Commonly reported CERT items included equipment usage and exercise tailoring. However, key aspects such as adherence, motivation, and intervention fidelity were consistently underreported. None of the included studies provided comprehensive details on exercise interventions as per CERT guidelines, limiting their reproducibility and clinical application. Conclusions: The quality of reporting on exercise-based interventions for SIS in overhead athletes remains insufficient. Critical gaps in adherence monitoring, patient motivation, and intervention fidelity were identified. Future research should prioritize standardized and detailed reporting of exercise interventions to enhance reproducibility and facilitate evidence-based clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Social Feedback Speech Technologies (SFST) are programs and devices, often “AI”-powered, that claim to provide users with feedback about how their speech sounds to other humans. To date, academic research has not focused on how such systems perform for a variety of speakers. In 2020, Amazon released a wearable called Halo, touting its fitness and sleep tracking, as well as its ability to evaluate the wearer’s voice to help them “understand how they sound to others”. The band presents its wearer with ‘Positivity’ and ‘Energy’ scores, as well as qualitative evaluations of the voice: adjectives such as ‘confident’, ‘hesitant’, ‘calm’, etc. This study evaluates how Halo performs for American English speakers of different races and genders. We recorded Black and white men and women reading three passages aloud and played them back to the same Halo device in identical positions. We then obtained Halo’s Energy and Positivity scores (out of 100), as well as the device’s qualitative descriptors of ‘tone of voice’ for each subject. We subsequently analyzed effects of different acoustic properties, as well as speaker race/gender and the interaction, for how the device scores ‘tone of voice’. Overall, Halo’s Energy ratings and qualitative descriptors are biased against women and Black speakers. Halo’s Positivity scores appear to be based on lexical sentiment analysis and therefore do not vary substantially by speaker. We conclude by discussing the expanding role of SFSTs and their potential harms related to the reinforcement of existing societal and algorithmic biases against marginalized speakers.",

        "abstract": "Background Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) is emerging as a promising digital technology for mental health care. CAI apps, such as psychotherapeutic chatbots, are available in app stores, but their use raises ethical concerns. Objective We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of ethical considerations surrounding CAI as a therapist for individuals with mental health issues. Methods We conducted a systematic search across PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, the Philosopher’s Index, and ACM Digital Library databases. Our search comprised 3 elements: embodied artificial intelligence, ethics, and mental health. We defined CAI as a conversational agent that interacts with a person and uses artificial intelligence to formulate output. We included articles discussing the ethical challenges of CAI functioning in the role of a therapist for individuals with mental health issues. We added additional articles through snowball searching. We included articles in English or Dutch. All types of articles were considered except abstracts of symposia. Screening for eligibility was done by 2 independent researchers (MRM and TS or AvB). An initial charting form was created based on the expected considerations and revised and complemented during the charting process. The ethical challenges were divided into themes. When a concern occurred in more than 2 articles, we identified it as a distinct theme. Results We included 101 articles, of which 95% (n=96) were published in 2018 or later. Most were reviews (n=22, 21.8%) followed by commentaries (n=17, 16.8%). The following 10 themes were distinguished: (1) safety and harm (discussed in 52/101, 51.5% of articles); the most common topics within this theme were suicidality and crisis management, harmful or wrong suggestions, and the risk of dependency on CAI; (2) explicability, transparency, and trust (n=26, 25.7%), including topics such as the effects of “black box” algorithms on trust; (3) responsibility and accountability (n=31, 30.7%); (4) empathy and humanness (n=29, 28.7%); (5) justice (n=41, 40.6%), including themes such as health inequalities due to differences in digital literacy; (6) anthropomorphization and deception (n=24, 23.8%); (7) autonomy (n=12, 11.9%); (8) effectiveness (n=38, 37.6%); (9) privacy and confidentiality (n=62, 61.4%); and (10) concerns for health care workers’ jobs (n=16, 15.8%). Other themes were discussed in 9.9% (n=10) of the identified articles. Conclusions Our scoping review has comprehensively covered ethical aspects of CAI in mental health care. While certain themes remain underexplored and stakeholders’ perspectives are insufficiently represented, this study highlights critical areas for further research. These include evaluating the risks and benefits of CAI in comparison to human therapists, determining its appropriate roles in therapeutic contexts and its impact on care access, and addressing accountability. Addressing these gaps can inform normative analysis and guide the development of ethical guidelines for responsible CAI use in mental health care.",

        "title": "Mind–body therapy for cardiometabolic risk in U.S. middle-aged Black adults: a scoping review",
        "abstract": "Background In the U.S., Black adults do not achieve the same life expectancy as their White counterparts, and this is attributable in large part to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mind–body therapy (MBT) interventions demonstrate improvements in cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors that promote CVD, with increased feasibility and acceptability in the general population. Less known is the feasibility, acceptability, and evidence of reduction in CMR factors in the U.S. Black population with MBT. Purpose This study aimed to synthesize the current state of research regarding MBT on CMR factors in middle-aged U.S. Black adults and identify gaps in the literature. Research Question 1: What types of studies have been conducted (study design, theoretical framework, and cultural relevance)? and Research Question 2: What is the feasibility and acceptability and effectiveness of MBT in Black adults for CMR reduction? Methods Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a review of three databases was conducted. Our inclusion criteria were articles that (1) describe empirical research; (2) assessed a MBT intervention in middle-aged (35–64) adults with a minimum of 60% Black adult participants for CMR reduction; and (3) written in English. Independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion and data extraction, with a third reviewer providing consensus. Results Fourteen articles met the eligibility criteria (n = 14). Characteristics included randomized controlled trials (8, 57.1%); single-arm (3, 21.0%); mixed methods (3, 21.0%); sample size (17–375); mean age range 43–64; female (6, 42.8%); theoretical framework (4, 28.6%); culturally adapted (7, 50.0%); and studies demonstrating feasibility and/or acceptability (7, 50.0%). Of the seven articles assessing CMR physiologic factors, five studies observed significant improvement. For the 11 studies assessing CMR psychological factors, 6 studies had statistically significant results and 3 studies identified trends toward positive statistical outcomes. Implication A growing body of literature across research stages demonstrating acceptability, and feasibility, and evidence of effectiveness for selected outcomes of MBT in middle-aged Black adults with CMR factors shows promise. Future research recommendations include greater recruitment of Black men for MBT studies, larger sample sizes, and utilizing culturally adapted interventions for engaging Black adults in MBT for reduced CMR factors.",

        "title": "Expanding access to NCD services via community retail pharmacies in LMICs: a systematic review of the literature",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a significant global health challenge. In LMICs, NCDs are an incresing driver of premature deaths and have substantial economic impacts, particularly on working-age adults. The World Health Organization has identified four priority NCDs – cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer – which are included in its Package of Essential Non-Communicable Disease Interventions for low-resource primary care settings. However, a shortage of healthcare professionals further compounds the problem. Pharmacists, who could play a pivotal role in NCD care, remain underutilised. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies on the role of community pharmacies and pharmacists in delivering NCD services in low- and middle-income settings and assessed their risk of bias. Searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, and CINAHL from 1990 to 2022, including English, French, or Spanish publications. Results Out of 1,284 articles, 23 met inclusion criteria, predominantly focusing on diabetes (65%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (22%), cancer (9%), and asthma (4%). Most studies were conducted in Asia (52%), followed by South America (22%) and Africa (13%). Significant improvements were observed in glycaemic control and medication adherence for diabetes, and in blood pressure management and adherence for hypertension. Positive outcomes were also seen in health behaviours for breast cancer, asthma, and cardiovascular disease risk management. Interventions were cost-effective for managing diabetes and hypertension in elderly patients. However, accessibility challenges were noted in vaccination programmes, and concerns about bias were identified, particularly in observational studies. Conclusions Expanding NCD services through community pharmacies in low and middle-income countries can significantly improve health outcomes. Pharmacists can enhance education, screening, and management for NCDs, leading to better disease control and patient satisfaction. Addressing resource constraints, legal barriers, and disease focus disparities is essential. Adequate training, financial incentives, and collaboration among stakeholders are crucial for integrating pharmacists into NCD care frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Performance invalidity is under-studied in countries outside of the United States of America (US), with non-English examinees and with those who have low levels or poor quality of education.Method: This cross-cultural neuropsychological study explored performance invalidity in South African adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) litigants (N = 100) who had 7‒12 years of poor quality of education and who spoke Afrikaans (n = 35), English (n = 9) or one of the indigenous African languages of Xhosa (n = 52), Swahili (n = 1), Pedi (n = 1), Sotho (n = 1) and Chichewa (n = 1) as first languages.Results: Using demographically appropriate cutoff scores for seven performance validity tests (PVTs), the prevalence of performance invalidity was calculated as being close to 30% for this group. Participants who failed zero or one PVT were categorized as performing validly, while those who failed ≥ 2 PVTs were categorized as performing invalidly, raising suspicion of feigned cognitive impairment. Only 9% of the participants failed three or more PVTs. Severity of brain injury and the demographic factors of age and level of education did not play a significant role in PVT failure.Conclusion: Considering the prevalence rate and that South African psychologists now have access to PVTs with demographically appropriated cutoff scores, South African psychologists no longer have an excuse not to include PVTs in their test batteries, even with examinees who have severe TBI.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Health inequities may be driven by demographics such as sex, language proficiency, and race-ethnicity. These disparities may manifest through likelihood of testing, which in turn can bias artificial intelligence models. The goal of this study is to evaluate variation in serum lactate measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Methods: Utilizing MIMIC-IV (2008–2019), we identified adults fulfilling sepsis-3 criteria. Exclusion criteria were ICU stay <1-day, unknown race-ethnicity, <18 years of age, and recurrent stays. Employing targeted maximum likelihood estimation analysis, we assessed the likelihood of a lactate measurement on day 1. For patients with a measurement on day 1, we evaluated the predictors of subsequent readings. Results: We studied 15,601 patients (19.5% racial-ethnic minority, 42.4% female, and 10.0% limited English proficiency). After adjusting for confounders, Black patients had a slightly higher likelihood of receiving a lactate measurement on day 1 (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.34), but not the other minority groups. Subsequent frequency was similar across race-ethnicities, but women had a lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.98). Interestingly, patients with elective admission and private insurance also had a higher frequency of repeated serum lactate measurements (IRR 1.70, 95% CI 1.61–1.81, and 1.07, 95% CI, 1.02–1.12, respectively). Conclusion: We found no disparities in the likelihood of a lactate measurement among patients with sepsis across demographics, except for a small increase for Black patients, and a reduced frequency for women. Variation in biomarker monitoring can be a source of data bias when modeling patient outcomes, and thus should be accounted for in every analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The rate of patients who leave without being seen (LWBS) from an emergency department (ED) is a common measurement of quality, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. We hypothesized that adding a nonclinical staff role, guest service ambassadors (GSA), to the ED waiting room would decrease LWBS rates and reduce existing differences by race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language for ED patients. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study at a quaternary care academic ED in the Midwestern United States with approximately 60,000 annual visits between April and December 2022. GSAs were trained to guide patients and visitors through the check‐in process and help manage the waiting room. LWBS rates were compared between pre‐ and postimplementation periods using logistic regression. Using two‐sample proportion tests, subgroup analyses were performed to assess differences according to race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language. Results We analyzed 50,507 ED visits including 9798 during periods of GSA coverage. GSA presence was associated with a reduction in LWBS rate from 3.4% to 2.0% (absolute risk reduction [ARR] of 1.4%, χ2 = 17.357, p < 0.001) with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.85). There was a greater reduction in LWBS for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) patients compared to White patients (BIPOC ARR 1.8%, 95% CI 0.39%–3.14%; White ARR 1.2%, 95% CI 0.48%–1.94%). There was a reduction in LBWS rates for both males and females (female ARR 1.7%, 95% CI 0.80%–2.63%; male ARR 1.0%, 95% CI 0.06%–1.90%). The reduction in LWBS for patients speaking a language other than English and requiring interpreter services did not meet statistical significance (ARR 1.4%, 95% CI −1.04% to 3.85%). Conclusions Although some disparities remain, our study suggests that GSAs may provide an effective strategy to reduce the overall LWBS rate and reduce disparities across diverse demographic groups including BIPOC and female patients.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is often associated with psychiatric conditions, notably anxiety and depression due to their poor visual function. Recognizing this relationship is important for healthcare professionals to holistically treat AMD patients potentially facing these psychiatric challenges.\n \n \n \n This study aims to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in AMD patients.\n \n \n \n A systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EMBASE. This review included English-language studies on anxiety or depression in AMD patients aged 18 years and above. Studies on other psychiatric disorders, review articles, or case reports were excluded. Gray literature from conference abstracts, theses, and dissertations was manually searched. The risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Data extraction focused on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0.\n \n \n \n Our search yielded 104 records, with 47 advancing to full-text review, resulting in the inclusion of 23 articles with 13,063 AMD patients. For depression, 18 studies were included, with significant heterogeneity between them (I\n 2 = 99.2%, P < 0.001). A random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird (D + L) method was applied, showing a pooled prevalence of depression of 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [15, 30]) among 12,444 AMD patients. Similarly, for anxiety, 17 studies were included, also showing a high level of heterogeneity (I\n 2 = 96.9%, P < 0.001). Using the same D + L random effects model, the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 14% (95% CI: [10, 17]) among 12,021 AMD patients.\n \n \n \n Healthcare providers and patients should be aware of the high prevalence of anxiety (14%) and depression (22%) in AMD and consider the possibility of routine mental health screening and appropriate management.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social determinants of health (SDoH) are environmental and socioeconomic factors that indirectly or directly influence health. This study examined whether SDoH that might relate to health literacy or access to health care are associated with lifetime history of parent-reported concussion in school-aged children and adolescents in the United States. We hypothesized that lower parental education, living in poverty, and speaking a language other than English as the primary language in the home would be associated with a lower lifetime history of concussion. Participants were parents or caregivers of 34,077 children and adolescents (ages 5–17) from the 2021 National Survey of Children’s Health. SDoH variables included primary language spoken at home, family income, parental level of education, and current health insurance. Univariable analyses assessed the individual association of each SDoH variable with lifetime history of concussion. A multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the combined association of SDoH variables and other demographic predictors with lifetime concussion history. In the univariable models, male gender, older age, sports participation, and having current health care coverage were associated with a higher lifetime history of concussion. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, primary language spoken at home other than English, lower level of parental education, living in poverty, and Black or Asian race were associated with lower lifetime history of concussion. In a multivariable model, significant independent predictors of lower lifetime concussion history were lower level of parental education, not speaking English as the primary language at home, and identifying as Black or Asian. It is possible that lower parental education, living in poverty, and speaking a language other than English as the primary language spoken are factors relating to lower concussion-related health literacy. Lower health literacy might contribute to families being less likely to (i) recognize the symptoms of concussion and (ii) seek medical evaluation for the injury.",

        "abstract": "Background: Research shows that media-based dietary and behavioral strategies can aid weight loss, but limited studies have been conducted among Black/African American adults. Objective: This review examines the literature on dietary and behavioral strategies for weight loss and maintenance among Black/African American adults, identifying the types of media used alongside these strategies. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Communication & Mass Media databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with no restrictions on the publication date. Two reviewers conducted the screening. Studies were included if they had >75% Black/African American adult participants (18 years and older), included behavioral or dietary strategies, had a media component, weight loss or maintenance as an outcome, and published in English language. Results: Nine studies (randomized control trials (n = 5), mixed-method studies (n = 2) and qualitative studies (n = 2)) were included. Behavioral strategies used to lose and maintain weight included goal setting (n = 4), self-monitoring (n = 5), and weekly self-weighing (n = 2). Limiting sugary drinks (n = 3), limiting junk and high fat foods (n = 5), aiming for a set number of calories per day (n = 3), portion control (n = 4), and increasing fruits and vegetable intake (n = 3) were the most common dietary strategies used to lose and maintain weight. Media used in the intervention studies included mHealth text messaging (n = 2), Facebook (n = 2), a website (n = 1), television (n = 1) and a mobile app (n = 1). Conclusions: The findings highlight the limited research on the utilization of media for behavioral and dietary weight loss strategies among Black/African American adults, indicating a need for future studies to explore and optimize media-based strategies for this population.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of different injective therapies for SIJ pain in SpA patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to January 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies in English, including comparative and non-comparative studies, and case series. A meta-analysis was performed on the available data. The “Checklist for Measuring Quality” by Downs and Black was used to evaluate the quality of included papers. Results: A total of 17 studies involving 494 patients were included: 12 prospective case series, 1 retrospective comparative study, 2 prospective comparative studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials. Steroid injections were analyzed in 15 studies, etanercept in 1, and infliximab in 1. A meta-analysis of 375 patients receiving steroid injections showed a significant reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) scores from 8.2 pre-treatment to 3.2 (p < 0.001) at short-term follow-up, with stability at mid-term follow-up (VAS 3.3, p < 0.001) and worsening at the last follow-up (VAS 5.1, p < 0.001). The failure rate was 13% (p = 0.019), and one study reported a 12.5% complication rate. Biologic therapies showed no complications or failures, with improvements in both VAS and BASDAI scores. Conclusions: Intra-articular steroid injections are effective and safe for SIJ pain in SpA patients, although their efficacy diminishes over time, and not all patients respond to treatment. Biologic therapies have shown promising results, but further research is needed to confirm their long-term efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases. Although physical exercise (PE) has emerged in the literature as an important modulator for reducing such risk, evidence remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of PE on cardiometabolic health in individuals with ASD. Methods: A systematic review was carried out according to the PRISMA guidelines, from their inception until 18 July 2023, in the following electronic databases: Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they focused on ASD patients undergoing physical exercise, assessing cardiometabolic risk, exercise tolerance, and QoL. The following were excluded: non-exercise interventions, additional therapies, non-English studies, and reviews. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed through the Downs and Black scale. Results: A total of four studies (149 participants) were included in this review, with the average methodological quality being rated as “fair”. Interventions had mixed effects on cardiometabolic health. The BMI (↓2.8 kg/m2), waist circumference (↓1.86 cm), and lipid profiles improved in some cases. VO2max and HRbaseline showed moderate gains. Secondary outcomes included enhanced endurance, strength, and calorie expenditure, especially in mild ASD. Autistic traits and quality of life improved post-intervention, with better results in the experimental groups. Conclusions: This review indicates that aerobic and functional training improves cardiometabolic health, autistic traits, and QoL in individuals with ASD, particularly in mild cases. Further research is needed to explore the impact of ASD severity on these outcomes.",

        "title": "Availability and accessibility of cytotoxic medicines in the WHO model list of essential medicines for childhood cancer in low and lower-middle- income countries: a systematic review",
        "abstract": "Background Socio-economic inequalities significantly impact paediatric cancer survival. The review aims to elucidate the facilitators and barriers influencing the availability and accessibility of essential medicines for childhood cancer (EMCC) in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). Methods This systematic review was conducted adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Peer- reviewed primary studies, national/regional reports, and policy documents published in the English language were included through a thorough literature search using three electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Review questions were framed according to the ECLIPS framework. Children under 19 years of age living in LLMICs diagnosed with any malignancy were the client group. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the mixed methods appraisal tool. Data is presented as a narrative synthesis. Enablers and barriers were discussed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) health system building blocks. Results Out of the 29 articles retrieved for full-text screening, the final synthesis included nine articles. Six were based on quantitative, two on mixed-method research, and one was a review article. These studies represented 26 LLMICs from several continents (Africa, Asia, and America). The alignment of the National Essential Medicine Lists (NEMLs) with the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List for Children (WHO EMC) varied from 40%- 60%. Overall stock out rate ranged from 17 to 100%. Stock out rate was higher in the public sector than in the private sector. International partnerships, policy changes, and financing strategies are some of the key enablers identified. Barriers included inadequate global drug production, high drug costs, weak regulatory enforcement, poor supply chain management, and insufficient health information systems. Conclusion The findings of our review revealed the failure of LLMICs to meet the WHO- recommended target of 80% availability for EMCCs. The availability and accessibility of EMCC in LLMICs are hindered by multiple systemic barriers despite several enabling strategies. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated global efforts and local initiatives to ensure equitable access to childhood cancer treatments in LLMICs. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022334156.

        "abstract": "Background: Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is increasing in the United States. The main objective of this study is to test the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to develop models for predicting SMM during delivery hospitalizations in Maryland. Secondarily, we examine disparities in SMM by key sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: We used the linked State Inpatient Database (SID) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey data from Maryland for 2016–2019 (N = 261,226 delivery hospitalizations). We first estimated relative risks for SMM across key sociodemographic factors (e.g., race, income, insurance, and primary language). Then, we fitted LASSO and, for comparison, Logit models with 75 and 18 features. The selection of SMM features was based on clinical expert opinion, a literature review, statistical significance, and computational resource constraints. Various model performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and recall values were computed to compare predictive performance. Results: During 2016–2019, 76 per 10,000 deliveries (1976 of 261,226) were in patients who experienced an SMM event. The Logit model with a full list of 75 features achieved an AUC of 0.71 in the validation dataset, which marginally decreased to 0.69 in the reduced model with 18 features. The LASSO algorithm with the same 18 features demonstrated slightly superior predictive performance and an AUC of 0.80. We found significant disparities in SMM among patients living in low-income areas, with public insurance, and who were non-Hispanic Black or non-English speakers. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing ML and administrative hospital discharge data for SMM prediction. The low recall score is a limitation across all models we compared, signifying that the algorithms struggle with identifying all SMM cases. This study identified substantial disparities in SMM across various sociodemographic factors. Addressing these disparities requires multifaceted interventions that include improving access to quality care, enhancing cultural competence among healthcare providers, and implementing policies that help mitigate social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Norovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. Individuals of all ages are susceptible to NoV, but young children and older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes, including death. Due to the challenges the genomic diversity of NoV presents for vaccine development, it is important to understand global patterns of genotype diversity in these populations with highest need.Figure 1. Genotype prevalence by year among global norovirus AGE cases in children < 18 years, 2002 to 2021 Years refer to the first year of each season; e.g. “2002” represents the 2002-2003 season. SUM GII.4 includes GII.4 Hong Kong, GII.4 Sydney, GII.4 Den Haag, GII.4 New Orleans, and Other/Unknown GII.4. Methods A targeted review was conducted in PubMed of English language studies from 2002-2022 that reported NoV genotype prevalence in children < 18 and adults ≥ 60. Studies were included that reported individual, genotyped cases (not outbreaks) with AGE symptoms. Prevalence of each genotype was estimated by season and geographic region by summing individual cases for each genotype across included studies.Figure 2. Genotype prevalence among global norovirus AGE cases in adults ≥ 60 years, 2010-2017 (n=176) Stratified analysis by season was not possible due to small sample size (N<20 cases for multiple years). SUM GII.4 includes GII.4 Hong Kong, GII.4 Sydney, GII.4 Den Haag, GII.4 New Orleans, and Other/Unknown GII.4. Results A total of 7,718 pediatric and 176 adult cases were included in the analysis, from 37 studies including children and 5 including older adults. In both children and adults, GII.4 was most prevalent across all years combined (55% and 84% of cases, respectively) (Figs. 1, 2). Among children, GII.3 was next most prevalent (18%), followed by GII.2 (10%); the most common GI genotype was GI.3 (2% of cases). In recent seasons (2018/19-2021/22), GII.4 prevalence ranged from 41% to 59%. In adults, analysis by year and region was limited by sample size. Overall, after GII.4, GII.2 was most prevalent (10% of cases), and GI genotypes were uncommon (< 1%) (Fig. 2). When pediatric cases were analyzed by region, GII.4 was most prevalent across region, but greater diversity in non-GII.4 cases was seen in Africa and Central/South America (Fig. 3). Genotype prevalence was similar for adults across regions where data were available (Fig. 4).Figure 3. Genotype prevalence among norovirus AGE cases in children < 18 years by geographic region, 2002-2021 Conclusion Analysis of genotyped symptomatic NoV AGE cases worldwide over two decades showed similar patterns in children and older adults over time, with consistent predominance of GII.4 in both age groups and across geographies, and greater diversity in children and in Africa and Central/South America among non-GII.4 cases. Data from adult populations were limited despite established disease burden in this age group. Contemporary data on circulating NoV genotypes will be needed for vaccine development, particularly among adults where data are scarce.Figure 4.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a parasitic disease of the CNS caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, and is the leading cause of acquired seizure disorder worldwide. This study is the first to explore the clinical characteristics and courses of NCC patients in Florida.Figure 1: Countries of Origin 76% of patients reported a country of origin outside of the United States (Mexico, 12; Guatemala, 4; Haiti, Nepal, El Salvador, 2; Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Mozambique, Nepal, Peru, 1) The remainder of patients did not specify a country of origin. Methods The inclusion criteria for this retrospective chart review included any patient presenting to UF Health Shands Hospital, Gainesville, FL, with symptomatic NCC diagnosed between June 1993-June 2023 given an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code of NCC confirmed by imaging, serology, or biopsy.Table 1: Epidemiological Characteristics of NCC Patients Selected epidemiological characteristics of 34 identified patients represented as percentages. Results 34 patients met inclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics of these patients included country of origin (76% non-USA, 24% unspecified), sex (59% Male, 41% Female), ethnicity (65% Hispanic, 32% non-Hispanic, 3% unspecified), age (68% 21-50, 18% 51-70, 15% 0-20), race (47% white, 12% black/AA, 9% Asian, 3% AIAAN, 29% unspecified), insurance status (41% uninsured, 21% insured, 38% unspecified), language preferred for medical correspondence (47% Spanish, 38% English, 6% other, 9% unspecified), and per capita income of Florida county of origin (53% bottom 50%, 41% top 50%, 6% unspecified). Select pre-, intra-, post-hospitalization features and outcomes were recorded. 52% of patients' cysts were staged. Symptoms at time of presentation included headaches (25%), seizures (20%), systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, malaise) (15%), and CNS deficits (10%). 97% of patients reported NCC symptoms prior to receiving an NCC diagnosis and 72% of patients presented to at least one healthcare facility for similar symptoms without receiving a diagnosis of NCC. Out of the 52% who were staged, 56% received incorrect medical management; these patients either received medications for inactive infection (18%) or did not receive proper medication for active infection (38%). 21% of patients were readmitted at least once for NCC symptoms or complications. 18% of patients stayed in the hospital for more than 10 days.Figure 2: Symptoms Prior to Presentation Symptoms patients reported experiencing prior to the time of their diagnostic presentation. Conclusion This research identifies a unique population of patients burdened by NCC and characterizes delays in patient presentation and diagnosis. This may aid clinicians in identifying common patient presentations associated with NCC to promote prompt and accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and close follow-up.Table 2: NCC Cyst Staging Cyst staging was performed for 53% of patients (18 in total); 27 cysts in total were staged representing multiple patients with more than one visible NCC cyst that was staged.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Globally, 296 million people are infected with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the Metropolitan-DC area, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) is 10 times more common in Asian, African, and Latin American communities (5% prevalence) than non-immigrants communities. Therefore, HBV-related liver disease, including cancer, is a major health disparity for immigrants. Antivirals reduce cancer risk but require long-term adherence. Immigrants face barriers to HBV antiviral adherence, including language, high cost of antivirals, and establishing care for HBV management. We examine antiviral use in a cohort of people with HBV. Methods HOPE is a natural history study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. HOPE enrolls adults with HBV and includes TEMUL, a sub-study providing free tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for 2 years. After completing 2 years of TEMUL, participants are transitioned to receiving antivirals through their non-study healthcare providers. We describe antiviral use while on TEMUL and at a 2-year follow-up. Results From May 2017 to March 2024, 92 people received TAF through TEMUL. Eighty-four were foreign-born (78 born in Asia and 6 born in Africa). Most (67%) had mild liver fibrosis at baseline. Eleven were withdrawn (3 lost to follow-up, 3 moved out of state, 5 voluntarily withdrew). Eighty-one completed TEMUL with sustained adherence to TAF. Fifty-eight completed a 2-year follow-up. At follow-up, 36 of 58 (62%) remained on TAF without interruption. Twelve (21%) switched antivirals because of insurance coverage. This caused lapses in antiviral use ranging from 1 month to 2 years in 5 (9%). Ten (17%) stopped antivirals due to loss of health insurance, high copay, and inability to follow-up with a healthcare provider. All 10 were foreign-born, Asian, and non-English speaking. Of these 10, 9 were viremic at follow-up and resumption of antivirals was clinically indicated in all. Conclusion Language and inadequate health insurance coverage hinder antiviral adherence in immigrants with HBV. Foreign-born, non-English speaking patients may be especially vulnerable to lapses in antiviral use. Interventions to improve access to antivirals tailored to this patient group are needed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Antibiotic use without a prescription (non-prescription use) is a highly prevalent issue that poses significant individual and population level risk. We designed a patient-focused educational brochure to reduce non-prescription antibiotic use and report patient survey results about the brochure’s acceptability, appropriateness, and usability.Figure 1. Brochure Usability, Appropriateness, and Acceptability For the three criteria of usability, appropriateness, and acceptability, responses of \"completely agree\" and \"agree\" were categorized as positive while \"neither agree or disagree,\" \"disagree,\" or \"completely disagree\" were categorized as negative responses. n = 100 respondents. Methods The brochure was developed with input from six racially/ethnically diverse community advisory board members plus 2 experts in health literacy and cultural competency in Hispanic communities. Brochure content included information on safe means of obtaining antibiotics, antibiotic side effects, non-antibiotic treatment of common symptoms, and how to access care at the public clinics. From October 2023 to February 2024, brochures (in English or Spanish) were distributed to 100 patients at two local clinics (50 each). Patients completed a survey about the brochure acceptability, appropriateness, and usability, followed by an open-ended question about suggestions for improvement. Results Survey participants were on average 53 years old, 72% female, 72% college educated, and primarily Black (35%), Hispanic or Latino (30%), or Caucasian (28%). 81% had adequate health literacy. Respondents largely found the brochure acceptable (98%), appropriate (98%), and usable (100%). 96% of respondents said the brochure was useful, referencing learning about antibiotic indications (23%), over the counter alternatives for symptom relief (23%), and antibiotic side effects (14%). The most common reason respondents did not find the brochure useful was they already “knew everything in [the] brochure” (n = 4). 15 respondents (15%) had suggestions for improvement such as having an alternative media form (e.g., an audio version) and having the brochure available at the pharmacy (27% each). Conclusion We designed a brochure about antibiotic safety that was considered acceptable, appropriate, and usable by our diverse clinic patients. Key learning points reported by patients included antibiotic indications, side effects, and over the counter alternatives. Next the brochure will be the focus of an intervention to reduce non-prescription antibiotic use among our socially vulnerable patient population.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background HIV/AIDS remains a significant public health challenge in the United States, especially in states with diverse populations such as Texas. This study examines viral load trends among people living with HIV in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio over ten years. The aim is to investigate variations in viral load suppression among individuals living with HIV across different cities, considering demographic variables like age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on people with HIV (PWH) from 2009 to 2019. Demographic data, clinical variables, and viral suppression status were analyzed across different groups using time-to-event analysis. Results The analysis revealed that being female was linked to a reduced hazard ratio for detectable viral load (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 - 0., p = 0.005) after adjusting for other demographic factors (table 2). Additionally, younger age groups (18-29, 30-39, and 40-49) exhibited significantly higher hazard ratios compared to those aged 50 and above, indicating a higher risk of detectable viral load. Race/ethnicity emerged as a significant factor, with Non-Hispanic Black individuals displaying a higher hazard ratio compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.48, p < 0.001). Furthermore, Medicaid-insured individuals demonstrated higher risk of detectable viral load, consistent with both univariate and multivariate analyses. However, language preference did not significantly influence viral load detection status, as evidenced by the absence of a significant difference between English and Spanish speakers in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion Our research investigates disparities in achieving viral load suppression among individuals with HIV in Texas. Younger people seem to encounter challenges in maintaining viral suppression compared to older age groups. The influence of social determinants of health is highlighted by racial/ethnic disparities. While our study did not find a significant impact of language barriers on viral load detection, further exploration is needed to better comprehend these results. Disclosures Karen J.

We conducted adjusted regression analyses to compare the odds of receiving individual key clinical practices that support breastfeeding, as well as the percent of key clinical practices received. Results While some key clinical practices were received at high rates, less than 25% of mothers received 100% of recommended key clinical practices. Compared to White non-Hispanic mothers, mothers from various racial and ethnic groups were at lower odds of receiving 100% of key clinical practices: Black non-Hispanic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.47–0.65)], English-Speaking Hispanic [AOR 0.79, 95% CI (0.71–0.88)], Spanish-speaking Hispanic [AOR 0.63, 95% CI (0.53–0.73)], and Asian/Pacific Islander non-Hispanic [AOR 0.54, 95% CI (0.47–0.63)]. Conclusions for Practice Despite a steady increase in the number of BFHI hospitals in the US, there are racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of BFHI key clinical practices. More US hospitals must adopt BFHI key clinical practices and consistently implement those practices for every racial and ethnic group.

        "abstract": "The paper examines the entries of 36 words for common animal sounds in two online English dictionaries, Cambridge Dictionaries and The Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, to see what information is provided in the entries. Previous work on English dictionaries has focused on meaning explanations of referential, arbitrary words. With the examination of onomatopoeic words for animal sounds, this paper expands the field beyond the study of arbitrary words and into words whose forms contribute to their meaning.\nThe results show that there are no consistent policies for how words for animal sounds are handled, or how the animal readings are separated from other possible meanings of the words. There is variation in how explicitly the animals are mentioned in the definitions of meaning, and if they are in fact mentioned at all. The entries for the verb and noun uses of the words may not contain the same information. The examples, in cases where the animal readings are exemplified at all, may come in a different entry from where the relevant definition of meaning is provided. One of the dictionaries also relies heavily on definitions where the word’s meaning is explained in terms of itself. The use of synonyms in the meaning explanations of onomatopoeic words is also found to be problematic. As these words do not merely identify a referent, but describe or imitate what the referent sounds like, exchanging one word for another does not carry over the same imagery of sound.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients need to be supported in combining treatment with daily life. However, measurement of supportive care indicators related to treatment-related side effects is under-reported. This review aimed to identify a list of quality indicators for managing cancer treatment-induced toxicities for adult patients with cancer. Methods A review was conducted on PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase from September 26, 2013 to December 26, 2023. Published English articles that developed or analyzed quality indicators of managing cancer treatment-induced toxicities for adult patients with cancer were selected. The identified indicators were classified according to Donabedian’s model for quality of care in healthcare. Results Forty-two indicators (4 structural, 27 process, and 11 outcome indicators) in 18 articles were identified. Eight articles (44.4%) were from North America, four (22.2%) from Europe, two (11.1%) from Oceania, two (11.1%) from Asia, and one (5.6%) from Africa; 64.3% of the indicators were process indicators based on guidelines. The prevalence of patient symptoms determined using a patient-reported outcome measure was proposed as an outcome indicator. In seven studies (38.9%), these indicators were selected by multidisciplinary experts. None of the studies involved patients or family members in the indicator selection process. Conclusion The quality of supportive care should be improved by measuring these indicators, considering the patient’s needs for supportive care at each hospital such that patients can continue their lives while undergoing treatment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWith 8.4% of Americans uninsured, free clinics serve as essential safety nets for underserved populations. This study compared the demographics of the patients of a student-run free to Toledo, Ohio, and national census data to evaluate health needs, barriers to care, and the characteristics of the underserved population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of 1,338 visits across five clinic sites was conducted from February 2023 to February 2024. Demographic variables, including race, insurance, education, sex, and primary language, were analyzed and compared to 2020 Census data from Toledo, Ohio, and the United States.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to Toledo, the clinic served 22.63% fewer White patients, 17.27% more Hispanic/Latino patients, and 5.62% fewer African American patients. Among clinic patients under 65 years, 61.91% were uninsured, compared to 8.3% in Toledo and 10.2% nationally. Non-English speakers were overrepresented (33.4% vs. 6.8% in Toledo and 9.5% nationally), with Spanish speakers making up 21.72% of clinic patients compared to 3.2% in Toledo. Educational attainment differed slightly, with fewer high school graduates (82.97% vs. 87.10% in Toledo) but more individuals with higher education degrees (27.10% vs. 19.6% in Toledo and 25.6% nationally).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study underscores the demographic differences between CCC patients and city, state, and national populations, offering insight into the populations most reliant on free clinics. Policymakers and public health agencies must consider these disparities to tailor interventions addressing healthcare access and social determinants of health.",

This study aims to analyze and estimate the effect of gender, marital status and residence on condom use among adults. \nSubject and Method: The systematic review and meta-analysis studies were conducted according to the PRISMA flowchart and PICO model. Population: Adults in general. Intervention: Gender (Female), Place of Residence (Rural) and Marital Status (Unmarried) in using condoms. Comparison: gender (male), place of residence (urban), and marital status (married). Outcome: condom use. The basic data used involves Google Scholar, PubMed, BMC, Scient Direct, and Springer Link with the keywords (“Use condom”) AND (“Gender”) AND (“Marital status”) AND (“Adult”) AND (“Cross -sectional”). Inclusion criteria were cross-sectional study articles in English published from 2014 to 2024. Data analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.3 application. \nResult: This meta-analysis included 14 cross-sectional studies from Ethiopia, Iran, Africa, and America. The sample size in this meta-analysis was 18,322. Meta-analysis showed that condom use was less in women (aOR= 0.66; 95% CI= 1.20 to 0.36; p 0.170), and more in rural areas (aOR= 0.80; 95% CI= 0.66 to 0.98; p= 0.620), with unmarried status (aOR = 0.92 CI 95%= 1.97 to 0.43; p 0.830). However, these three results were not statistically significant. \nConclusion: Condom use is less among women and more in rural areas with unmarried status.",

        "abstract": "Given Ghana’s position as first independent nation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah made a conscious effort to project the nation as an example of what Black Africa could accomplish, through largescale architectural projects. He took up the decision to build a new harbour together with a new town, Tema, as part of the Volta River Dam Project. In 1960, he hired prominent Greek architect and planner, Costantinos Apostolou Doxiadis, who radically revised what had been an earlier English plan. The current study investigates the role of Doxiadis in the development of Tema. It argues that his role transcended the provision of a master plan for Tema and involved several services to the government that went over and above that of a traditional planner. Using archival research, observations, interviews, and urban plan analyses, this study demonstrates not only how his ideas were implemented on the ground (Community 4), but also how these impacted developments that took place after the phase that involved his active participation. As the study shows by means of satellite imagery analysis, later and current community developments - undertaken by indigenous planners deviated - from the strict Ekistics approach that was adopted in the early stages.",

        "abstract": "Many online health information sources are generic and difficult to understand, but consumers want information to be personalized and understandable. Smartphone health applications (apps) offer personalized information to support health goals and reduce preventable chronic conditions. This study aimed to determine how the HealthyMe/MiSalud personalized app (1) engaged English-speaking African American and Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults, and (2) motivated them to set goals and follow preventive recommendations. Our study adds to the literature on digital health, health information seeking, and prevention. We used a multi-method approach, including community and participatory design principles, to learn about potential African American and Hispanic adult health app users and evaluate the app in two usability tests and a 12-month field test. Ninety-six African American and Hispanic adults downloaded the HealthyMe/MiSalud app and used it for a minimum of 36 weeks. We found they wanted personalized information on core prevention topics, and their health histories and goals affected how they rated topic relevance. African American females ages 18-34 were more likely to save an article aligned with family health history, and African American females aged 35-49, males age 50-64, and African American males overall were more likely to save an article aligned with their health goals. Our study revealed that a prevention app with personalized recommendations can support health information seeking and health literacy. These findings can help app developers, public health practitioners, and researchers when designing apps for groups of varying identities.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Lichen planopilaris (LPP) and frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) are primary scarring alopecias that few authors consider the same entity, and some consider them different. Only a few reviews focus on trichoscopic findings in delineating these two alopecias. Objective We describe and summarize the trichoscopic features of both conditions. Methods We performed an extensive literature search using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The Chi-square test was applied to compare the trichoscopic features in LPP and FFA. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Out of 60 articles, 33 (16 LPP, 17 FFA) were considered for quantitative analysis due to availability in English literature with full text. We found that peripilar cylindrical casts and perifollicular erythema with arborizing vessels were predominant features suggesting early LPP. In contrast, yellow dots, perifollicular erythema, and scattered pigmentation suggested active FFA. Shiny-white area was seen in both groups in the inactive stages. The target arrangement of blue-grey dots, milky-red areas, and irregularly arranged white fibrotic dots were seen in late LPP, and black dots, lonely hairs, and loss of vellus hairs were detected in the later stages of FFA. Features such as blue-grey structureless areas, blue-white veil, and variability in morphologies of hair shafts were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion This article provides a comprehensive literature review on the trichoscopic features of LPP and FFA, including comparing the similarities, differences, and peculiarities of both conditions.",

        "abstract": "Objective  Congenital heart disease (CHD) is an important contributor to pediatric morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD exist across racial and ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to share the experiences of Hispanic and Black families with CHD to better understand their needs. Study Design  This was a descriptive qualitative study involving two 2-part focus groups, one conducted in English and one in Spanish, consisting of parents of infants with CHD. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via a conventional content analysis approach. Results  Six family members participated, representing a range of cardiac diagnoses. Two participants cited their identity as non-Hispanic Black and four as Hispanic. Three organizing themes emerged related to (1) communication, (2) psychosocial needs and processing, and (3) practical challenges associated with having a child with CHD. Together, these organizing themes supported a singular global theme: structural and socioemotional gaps in care exist for families of infants with CHD that need to be met in order to optimize care for patients and families. Conclusion  Societal and systems-level factors, including structural inequities, contribute to the care gaps experienced by racial and ethnic minority families of children with CHD. Key Points Poor communication around CHD diagnosis impairs provider–patient trust. Language barriers hinder accurate communication about CHD diagnosis and treatment. Parents of children with CHD have unmet mental health needs. Perinatal providers should champion health equity for CHD patients and their families.",

        "abstract": "Background/aims To examine the association between sociodemographic characteristics and attendance at Hospital Eye Service (HES) referrals from the Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP), in a large, ethnically diverse urban population. Methods Retrospective cohort study (4 January 2016–12 August 2019) of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) referred from an English DESP to a tertiary referral eye hospital. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression with attendance as the primary outcome, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation, best eye visual acuity and baseline DR grade. Results Of 7793 people referred (mean age 64 years, 62.6% male, 13.9% white, 12.5% black, 25.3% South Asian, 6.5% any other Asian background, 19.3% no recorded ethnicity and 20.9% of ‘Other’ ethnic origin), 69% attended. Compared with white individuals, people of black ethnic origin were similarly likely to attend. South Asians and those of other Asian backgrounds were more likely, and people with ‘Other’ or missing ethnicity were less likely to attend. Those with higher levels of deprivation, younger (aged 18–45 years) and older (76–90 years) age groups and worse visual acuity were less likely to attend, whereas people identified as having proliferative DR in both eyes were more likely to attend. Conclusion Sociodemographic patterns in attendance after referral from the DESP to the HES exist, and these do not appear to explain ethnic differences in more severe sight-threatening DR, suggesting other explanations. More work is needed to understand and reduce inequalities in HES attendance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social psychological research on race and racism has shown that claims about racism are not always accepted or received as valid reports. In this paper, I offer racial epistemics as one mechanism by which race‐talk takes place. I examine how ascribing category‐bound entitlements to experiential or other knowledge about racism is variously realised and complicated in the production of claims about racism. Through examining news media accounts where Black persons were invited to talk about their experiences of racism in India, I show that despite ascribing a privileged epistemic position to Black persons, recipients (interviewers and other panellists) could make salient epistemic entitlements to commonsense, specialised, or other forms of (racial) knowledge in collaboratively establishing, confirming or correcting, and challenging claims about racism in India. The findings are discussed in relation to the broader understanding of racism in social psychology. The data are in Indian English.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common diabetes complication and a leading cause of blindness. Although bariatric surgery (BS) is well studied for diabetes management, its effects on DR onset and progression, particularly long-term outcomes, remain underexplored. This review seeks to evaluate the short- and long-term retinal outcomes of BS in diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, including the use of the PRISMA checklist and flow diagram. The search included English-language articles (2014–2024) using keywords like “diabetic retinopathy” and “bariatric surgery”. The review excluded studies published in languages other than English, as well as reviews, case reports, and those lacking adequate data or relevance. The risk of bias was determined by using the Downs and Black checklist. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, and the results were organized and displayed in tables to summarize and compare the main findings. Results: After screening 158 articles, 13 studies involving 17,903 patients were selected, focusing on the effects of BS on DR progression and regression. Short-term data suggest that BS may stabilize or improve DR but poses risks of worsening in advanced cases, requiring careful monitoring. However, long-term findings are inconsistent, with evidence of both DR regression and progression. These variations highlight the need for further research. Discussion: BS generally improves DR progression, but its effect depends on preoperative severity and glycemic control. Further studies should explore additional risk factors to better predict DR outcomes post-surgery. Conclusions: BS improves weight management, blood pressure, and diabetes control, potentially benefiting DR. However, the long-term effects remain uncertain due to conflicting findings. Rapid glycemic changes after surgery may pose risks of DR progression. Large-scale, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the role of BS in DR progression and regression.",

        "abstract": "Objective Studies in the USA examining the relationship between ethnicity and colorectal cancer (CRC) identified significant variation. This study sought to examine the relationship between ethnic group, route to diagnosis, early-onset CRC and stage at diagnosis in the English National Health Service. Methods Data from COloRECTal cancer data Repository for all individuals diagnosed with CRC (International Classification of Diseases version 10, C18–C20) between 2012 and 2017. A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the study population was performed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between ethnicity, route to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis and early-onset CRC. Results Early-onset CRC was least common in those in the white ethnic group (5.5% diagnosed <50, vs 17.9% in the Asian, 15.5% in the black and 21.8% in the mixed and multiple ethnic groups, p<0.01). Diagnosis following a 2-week wait referral was significantly less common among individuals from the Asian, black, other and unknown ethnic groups than the white ethnic group (Asian OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91, black OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93, other OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.90 and unknown OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.73). The Asian ethnic group had significantly lower odds of emergency diagnosis than the white ethnic group (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). Following adjustment, individuals from the Asian ethnic group were significantly less likely, than their white counterparts, to be diagnosed at stage IV (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88). Conclusion This study identified different demographic profiles of those diagnosed with CRC between broad ethnic groups, highlighting the need to consider access to diagnostic CRC services in the context of ethnicity.",

        "abstract": "Black tea, a popular beverage, is rich in polyphenols. However, thorough analyses of clinical trial evidence supporting its health benefits are lacking. This narrative review is aimed at addressing this knowledge gap by synthesizing findings across pivotal clinical domains and identifying critical areas for further investigation. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed for English-language papers from January 1990 to July 2024, focusing on cardiovascular and metabolic health, as well as cognitive function. Findings from clinical trials indicated that consuming black tea regularly enhances endothelial and vascular health, notably by improving flow-mediated vasodilation. These advantages are largely due to the tea's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota–modulating effects, including the promotion of beneficial bacterial species such as Flavonifractor plautii. Effects on metabolic health, such as lipid profiles and glucose metabolism, were inconsistent. However, black tea was linked to improved cognitive function, especially attention and alertness, likely due to caffeine and L-theanine. Despite these promising results, further research is needed to overcome limitations like small sample sizes and short study durations. Future studies should be aimed at standardizing black tea preparations to optimize health benefits.",

        "abstract": "Objective In the UK and worldwide, there are substantial ethnic inequalities in maternal and perinatal care and outcomes. We aim to assess the impact of the unprecedented change in care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic on inequalities in adverse maternity outcomes. Design Retrospective cohort study using structured electronic health record data. Setting English hospital trusts providing maternity care. Participants Women giving birth and babies born in the National Health Service (NHS) in England between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2021, in three time groups: prepandemic, the first pandemic wave (26 March 2020 to 30 June 2020) and second pandemic wave (1 July 2020 to 31 March 2021). Self-reported ethnicity was grouped into White, South-Asian, Black, Mixed and Other. Main outcome measures Composite and component measures of maternal (emergency caesarean section, obstetric anal sphincter injury, hysterectomy, sepsis, anaesthetic complications and prolonged hospital stay) and perinatal (stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, brain injury, small for gestational age and prolonged hospital stay). Poisson regression was used to compare relative risks between different ethnic groups. Findings 1.54 million maternal and 1.43 million neonatal records were included. The overall incidence of adverse outcomes per 1000 births initially decreased maternal: from 308.0 (95% CI 307.0 to 309.0) to 291.0 (95% CI 311.4 to 314.9) (p<0.001); perinatal: from 133.0 (95% CI 132.3 to 133.7) to 111.9 (95% CI 110.1 to 113.7) (p<0.001)), but then increased in the second pandemic period (maternal: 313.2 (95% CI 311.4 to 314.9) (p<0.001); perinatal 118.9 (95% CI 117.7 to 120.0) (p<0.001)). The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in women and babies from all ethnic minority groups compared with White women in both pandemic periods. Black and South-Asian women and babies were approximately 25% more likely to sustain adverse outcomes. While similar overall changes in adverse outcomes were seen in all groups, existing inequalities were sustained throughout the pandemic periods. Interpretation Existing inequalities in adverse maternal and perinatal/neonatal outcomes were maintained, not tempered, during the pandemic, despite substantial changes to maternity services and care. Further research on possible interventions to reduce inequality is needed.",

        "abstract": "Objective The application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in the healthcare domain is still limited. End-users’ difficulty understanding how the outputs of opaque black AI models are generated contributes to this. It is still unknown which explanations are best presented to end users and how to design the interfaces they are presented in (explanation user interface, XUI). This article aims to provide an overview of recommendations for the user-centered design of XUIs from the scientific literature. Methods A scoping review was conducted to identify recommendations for the design of XUIs. Articles published between 2017 and 2022 in English or German, presenting original research or literature reviews, focusing on XUIs for end users or domain experts, which are intended for presentation in graphical user interfaces and from which recommendations could be extracted were included in the review. Articles were retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Explore, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and PsychInfo. A mind map was created to organize and summarize the identified recommendations. Results From the 47 included articles, 240 recommendations for the user-centered design were extracted. The organization in a mind map resulted in 64 summarized recommendations. Conclusion This review provides a synopsis of basic recommendations for the user-centered design of XUIs, focusing on the healthcare domain. During the analysis of the articles, it became clear that no specific and directly implementable design recommendations for AI-based CDSS can be given, but only basic recommendations for raising awareness about the user-centered design of XUIs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face myriad barriers to healthcare, including preventative sexual health services. A street medicine team in one Northern California county observed low uptake of sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening among PEH. We conducted this study to understand the factors contributing to PEH’s decision to seek or accept STI screening. Methods This is a qualitative study using semistructured interviews and demographics surveys among PEH. The interviews focused on understanding facilitators and barriers to STI screening and experiences in healthcare settings more broadly. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thorough memoing process and matrix-based analysis. Results We enrolled a total of 50 adult, English-speaking PEH: 24 men, 26 women; 52% white, 28% Black/African American, 22% Native American, 4% Asian, 22% Hispanic/Latino. Qualitative analysis revealed a theme of ‘dehumanising’ prior experiences in healthcare environments including judgement, dismissal of medical concerns, and denial of treatment. Participants reported similar experiences outside of medical settings, which together shaped their self-worth and factored into their decision to delay seeking routine and urgent forms of care, including STI screening. Approximately half of the participants had received medical services from the street medicine team. PEH perceived the street medicine team to foster trust by physically, emotionally and structurally ‘meeting patients where they are’. Conclusion Prior experiences of exclusion within and outside of healthcare settings informed PEH’s decision to avoid seeking healthcare until extremely urgent, and to deprioritise services like STI screening. In order to develop interventions to increase STI screening and other preventative health services, it is critical to understand the structural elements underlying relationships between PEH and healthcare systems, and the relevance of social exclusion beyond medicine. This street medicine team exemplifies features of structural competency, a model that may be integrated in other settings and in medical education to promote more equitable and inclusive healthcare.",

        "abstract": "This brief provides an innovative and practical manner in which to better engage community advisory boards (CABs) with data analysis. A growing number of scholars are interested in better integrating the community into the data analysis of community based participatory research, community engaged, and/or participatory action research. Participatory data analysis with the community is a critical way diverse communities with lived expertise can inform analysis and interpretation of data grounded in community’s voice, perspectives, and meanings. We describe the cervical cancer project, whereby a community advisory board (CAB) was integrated into qualitative data analysis starting by focusing on the codebook, an integral part of data analysis. This brief provides three specific ways in which participatory qualitative analysis can improve the manner in which research engages the community. We outline one opportunity for scholars to actively engage community partners virtually in the data analysis using the codebook with specific strategies to facilitate participation. We encourage researchers to consider these strategies for disruption when re-thinking the practice of CBPR especially during the analysis stage particularly when it comes to research with black, indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC), under-represented, or marginalized communities with limited English, literacy and/or education levels.",

        "abstract": "Senator John McCain may have been on point when he described mixed martial arts (MMA) as “human cock-fighting” in its formative years in the early 1990s in the United States of America (US). Those early MMA contests were no-holds-barred brutal affairs, fought between bloodied combatants of all shapes, sizes and combat styles, in a metal cage. Like bare-knuckle prize-fighting during the 18th and 19th centuries, this new form of combat sport closely resembled a glorified street fight. The sheer brutality of these spectacles ultimately led to the banning of MMA across the US. Realising that MMA’s future depended on governmental sanction and regulation, its organisers actively sought out such sanction and regulation. Although MMA is now legal in all US states, its regulation in both the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa has lagged behind, raising uncertainty about its legality in these jurisdictions. This uncertainty has been exacerbated by the absence of legislative intervention and judicial scrutiny regarding MMA in both the UK and South Africa. There is, furthermore, a dearth of academic literature addressing this legal lacuna. This study endeavours to bridge that gap by examining the legality of MMA in South Africa. In so doing, guidance is sought from the manner in which the English courts have approached boxing and other activities that entail consensual bodily harm, such as sadomasochism.",

        "title": "TYPES OF TERMINOLOGICAL COLLOCATIONS IN MEDICAL ENGLISH DISCOURSE",
        "abstract": "Background. The problem of word compatibility has been actively studied by Western and Russian researchers since the middle of the XX century. Any language is known to be a living and constantly developing system, within which certain speech patterns are formed. According to the lexical approach, words do not exist separately, the language consists of ready-made lexical chunks that can be easily recalled from memory and used while speaking. Such ready-made chunks include collocations, idioms, set expressions, etc. This study is devoted to the problems of common collocations in medical English. \nPurpose – to analyze the lexical content of well-known courses of medical English, authentic dictionaries and textbooks on medicine for identification and classification of terminological collocations. \nMaterials and methods. Courses of medical English published by Oxford and Cambridge University press: «English in Medicine» (E.H. Glendinning, B.A.S. Holmstrom); «Professional English in Use: Medical» (E.H. Glendinning, R. Howard); «Test Your Professional English: Medical» (A. Pohl); «Check Your English Vocabulary for Medicine» (A&C Black); «Nursing 1» (T. Grice), some authentic medical dictionaries (London Dictionary of Medical Terms; Stedman's Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions & Nursing; Illustrated Medical Dictionary - A Dorling Kindersley Book) and textbooks on medicine: Anatomy and Physiology for Health Professionals (J. Moini); Eyewitness. Human Body (R. Walker); How it Works Book of the Human Body (Imagine Publishing Ltd); The Facts on File Illustrated Guide to the Human Body (The Diagram Group). \nResults. The article analyses various definitions of the term \"collocation\", describes its main characteristics, presents the classification of the most common terminological collocations used in medical English. \nThe research shows that various types of terminological collocations are present in different types of medical discourse. These lexical units describe the structure and state of the human body, name medical staff, equipment and technologies, characterize common methods of diagnosis and treatment, etc. Therefore, when working with medical information in English, it is necessary to pay special attention to their structure and use.",

        "abstract": "This research focuses on the eco-activist multimodal imagery in English postmodern fairy tales and short stories for children as a crucial tool in meaning-making. It is claimed that literary texts for children dynamically reflect current global trends in culture, environmental pollution, gender equality, and family issues. While some topics remain taboo for young readers, others are increasingly prevalent, gradually replacing magical worlds with more realistic, thought-provoking imagery. It has been observed that in recent years, the participation of young people and children in the eco-activist movement has been increasing. They advocate for environmental preservation and solving urgent environmental problems. Literary texts for children are essential tools for fostering a responsible attitude toward the environment at a young age. Due to them, child-readers are introduced to crucial eco-centric issues and ways of solving them and taught the consequences of their actions on nature.\nThe analysis of our case study reveals that the protagonists of eco-activist fairy tales are primarily children concerned about environmental issues. Shadow narratives and the point of view of the child-focaliser are realized by the visual means, i.e. visual metaphors, salience of definite objects on the pictures, interplay of colours and shapes. It has been observed that visual imagery expands, clarifies environmental protection issues and appeals to the better understanding of child-readers their role in preserving the planet and keeping it clean and safe for living. Visual components clearly show the child-reader the damage caused to the environment by human activity: polluted air, water bodies and cities, injured animals, and deforestation. Important meanings are embedded in the dominant colours of the illustrations: green and blue predominate in the illustrations of nature, while grey and black accompany the images of the results of anthropogenic activity. The victory of Good (nature) in fairy tales is represented by a shift from grey and black to green. Intertextual links between literary texts for children by the same author can be formed through illustrations. Thus, a single fictional world is created in which the eco-activist activity of a child-antagonist is not an isolated phenomenon.",

        "title": "Exploring the Applications of Explainability in Wearable Data Analytics: Systematic Literature Review",
        "abstract": "Background Wearable technologies have become increasingly prominent in health care. However, intricate machine learning and deep learning algorithms often lead to the development of “black box” models, which lack transparency and comprehensibility for medical professionals and end users. In this context, the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a crucial solution. By providing insights into the inner workings of complex algorithms, XAI aims to foster trust and empower stakeholders to use wearable technologies responsibly. Objective This paper aims to review the recent literature and explore the application of explainability in wearables. By examining how XAI can enhance the interpretability of generated data and models, this review sought to shed light on the possibilities that arise at the intersection of wearable technologies and XAI. Methods We collected publications from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, SpringerLink, JMIR, Nature, and Scopus. The eligible studies included technology-based research involving wearable devices, sensors, or mobile phones focused on explainability, machine learning, or deep learning and that used quantified self data in medical contexts. Only peer-reviewed articles, proceedings, or book chapters published in English between 2018 and 2022 were considered. We excluded duplicates, reviews, books, workshops, courses, tutorials, and talks. We analyzed 25 research papers to gain insights into the current state of explainability in wearables in the health care context. Results Our findings revealed that wrist-worn wearables such as Fitbit and Empatica E4 are prevalent in health care applications. However, more emphasis must be placed on making the data generated by these devices explainable. Among various explainability methods, post hoc approaches stand out, with Shapley Additive Explanations as a prominent choice due to its adaptability. The outputs of explainability methods are commonly presented visually, often in the form of graphs or user-friendly reports. Nevertheless, our review highlights a limitation in user evaluation and underscores the importance of involving users in the development process. Conclusions The integration of XAI into wearable health care technologies is crucial to address the issue of black box models. While wrist-worn wearables are widespread, there is a notable gap in making the data they generate explainable. Post hoc methods such as Shapley Additive Explanations have gained traction for their adaptability in explaining complex algorithms visually. However, user evaluation remains an area in which improvement is needed, and involving users in the development process can contribute to more transparent and reliable artificial intelligence models in health care applications. Further research in this area is essential to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence models used in wearable health care technology.",

        "abstract": "This study examines language issues that arise in social media. Users of TikTok frequently contribute images, videos, and memes. Users of TikTok also left comments on the post in a variety of languages.  Slang is used, and the language style has been studied. The purpose of this study was to understand how slang is put together, what it means, and what its function is. The justification for utilizing slang was revealed in user comments on TikTok. The researcher is interested in talking about the phenomena of African American English slang terms seen in comments on TikTok social media with regard to this issue.  Additionally, this study uses a qualitative, descriptive approach. The information was gathered from TikTok users' comment sections over a specific time period. The theory of the functions of slang is from Zhou and Fan (2013), and the framework for the types of slang is based on the theory of Allan & Burridge (2006). The analysis's findings indicate that there are four categories of slang utilized by TikTok users: Clipping, Acronyms, Fresh and Creative, and Flippant. Slang among TikTok users serves purposes related to pursuing self-identity and emotive feelings. The sociolinguistic approach is utilized to better comprehend the slang expressions found in TikTok comments and to address the two issues that have resulted from them.",

While in older German forensic literature, yellow meconium has been occasionally mentioned from the 19th century on - without any conclusions being drawn from this finding whether the newborn was alive or had been fed -, current forensic literature does not provide information about this phenomenon.

        "abstract": "Background & aims Effective treatment for anterior drooling in children with neurological disorders can lead to improved social interactions, reduced physical complications such as perioral infections, and enhanced quality of life for both patients and their parents. Elastic therapeutic taping (ETT) has emerged a novel intervention for drooling, but its evidence was limited. This study systematically reviewed the effectiveness of ETT on reducing anterior drooling in children with neurological disorders. Methods Multiple electronic databases, such as Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception till 30th October 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they: (a) used ETT as a treatment for drooling or swallowing difficulties; (b) included participants aged < 18 years old; (c) included participants with anterior drooling and neurological disorders; (d) compared effects of ETT alone or combined with other treatments (e.g. oral motor therapy (OMT)) with no taping, sham taping or other treatments, and (e) published in English. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was used to assess risk of bias for the included studies. Results Seven parallel-arm RCTs, which were conducted in South/southwest Asia, Africa, South America and Middle East, were included. In total, 220 children aged 1 to 11 were included, of which 97 received solely ETT in 4 studies, while 24 received ETT plus OMT in 2 studies. ETT combined with OMT was more effective in reducing drooling in the included 2 RCTs, though the results of ETT alone were inconsistent, likely due to heterogeneity observed in control conditions, application methods, and outcome measures. No side effects were reported in all studies. Conclusions This review suggests that ETT combined with OMT is effective in reducing drooling in children with neurological disorders, with no evidence of side effects.

        "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, through the 2030 Agenda, seeks to address the various problems affecting the global population. For this, 17 goals and 162 subgoals were established, agreed by the member countries in 2015 at the COP 21 event in Paris. Therefore, the objective of this Scoping Review was to collect data produced in the world literature, which addressed themes linked to sustainability, education, curriculum, water and basic sanitation, in an integrated way, which dealt more specifically with goals 4 (Quality Education) and 6 (Water and Basic Sanitation) of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It also aimed to find teaching networks in the most diverse countries, which used the curriculum, to bring the themes proposed by the UN into the classroom. To search for articles published in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, the period from June 2017 to June 2022 was taken into account. In addition, official guiding documents were also investigated. A total of 2,803 potential items were obtained. From this total, around 2,720 were eliminated for not meeting the guiding strings in this research, leaving 83 articles/documents. After further reading, 44 articles/documents met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was found on all continents and in the most diverse countries, with different priorities. The countries that are part of the OECD have worked on these issues intending to improve their indicators. The so-called emerging countries (Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa, and Turkey, among others), on the other hand, treat the same data to improve educational metrics and universalize the quality of water supply and sanitation. Finally, in the countries that fall into the peripheral group, the findings were based on a rights guarantee approach, i.e., still from the perspective of implementing and consolidating public policies, such as some Latin American countries, South/Southeast Asia, and the vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries.",

        "abstract": "Background UK Asian and Black patients experience longer cancer diagnostic intervals — the period between initial symptomatic presentation in primary care and cancer diagnosis. Aim To determine whether the differences in diagnostic intervals are because of prolonged primary care, referral, or secondary care interval. Design and setting A cohort study was undertaken of 70 971 patients with seven cancers (breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, oesophagogastric, myeloma, ovarian) diagnosed after symptom presentation in English primary care. Method Data on symptom presentation and diagnosis were extracted from cancer registry-linked primary care and secondary care data. Primary interval was defined as the period between first primary care presentation and secondary care referral, referral interval as the period between referral and first secondary care appointment, and secondary care interval as the period between the first secondary care appointment and diagnosis. Accelerated failure time models were used to investigate ethnic differences across all four intervals. Results Across all sites, the median diagnostic interval was 46 days, ranging from 13 days for breast cancer to 116 days for lung cancer. It was 14% longer for Black patients (adjusted time ratio [ATR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.25) and 13% longer for Asian patients (ATR 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.23) compared with White patients. Site-specific analyses showed that, for myeloma, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, the secondary care interval was longer in Asian and Black patients, who also had a longer primary care interval in breast and colorectal cancer. There was little evidence of ethnic differences in referral interval. Conclusion This study found evidence of ethnic differences in diagnostic intervals, with prolonged secondary care intervals for four common cancers and prolonged primary care intervals for two. Although these differences are relatively modest, they are unjustified and may indicate shortcomings in healthcare delivery that disproportionately affect ethnic minorities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAdults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and adverse social determinants of health experience barriers to healthful eating, and achieve poorer glycemic control and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the impact of medically tailored meals (MTM) with medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on clinical outcomes among adults with DM.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPilot randomized controlled trial.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nEnglish-speaking adults with DM and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels > 8% insured by Maryland Medicaid plans.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nThe treatment group received home delivery of 12 medically tailored, frozen meals and a fresh produce bag weekly for 3 months, and individual calls with a registered dietitian monthly for 6 months in addition to usual care. The control group received usual care. Outcomes were change from baseline to 6 months in A1c (primary), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, food insecurity, and diabetes-related quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy (secondary).\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nWe randomized 74 adults; 77% completed data collection. The mean age was 48 years, 40% were male, 77% were Black, and the mean A1c was 10.3%. Eighty-six percent of meals were delivered, and on average 4.8 nutrition visits were completed. At 6 months, both groups had similar improvements in A1c (- 0.7 vs. - 0.6%); the control group reported more favorable changes in diabetes medications. Changes in systolic blood pressure and BMI at 6 months did not differ between groups. Diabetes-related quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy improved modestly, but not differently by group. Food insecurity decreased significantly from baseline to 3 months in the intervention (53 to 17%) compared to control (48 to 44%; p < 0.05), which lessened but remained significant at 6 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRecruitment and retention of an at-risk group of adults with DM was feasible. Intervention uptake was good but did not improve clinical outcomes. More comprehensive and clinically integrated interventions are likely needed to achieve significant clinical benefits.\n\n\nCLINICALTRIALS\n\n\n\nGOV REGISTRATION\nNCT04034511.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to dwell on students’ perceptions and attitudes towards metaphoric terms and some approaches that contribute to the comprehension and acquisition of basic physics metaphoric terminology for 1st-year undergraduate engineering students. Physics English terminology comprehension and acquisition is of great importance when it comes to these students. Being the lingua franca of today, mastering the basic terminology of the respective field of interest in English is demanding for everyone who aspires to have a deep understanding of their field of interest and a prosperous career in the future. To have an effective input and output in the teaching/learning process a collaboration among professionals of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and ESP (English for Specific Purposes) is necessitated. Physics is fundamentally dependent on abstract notions that frequently lack tangible counterparts, such as in these metaphoric terms \"tunneling effect\" or \"black hole\".  Concepts expressed through such metaphoric terms assist students to envision, conceive, and acquire the latter, but can also hinder their understanding of concepts. To conduct this research, a semi–structured questionnaire was handed to 100 students of Polytechnic University of Tirana to investigate their beliefs towards these terms and to determine different approaches that will contribute to their understanding of the above-mentioned terms. The results concluded that students face challenges in comprehending a metaphoric unknown term. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the most used and preferred approaches to learning these terms are related to the professor’s assistance with explanation, analogy with everyday experiences, and visual aids, videos mainly. This study highlights the importance of collaboration between STEM and ESP in combining the linguistic-semantic nature of terms and their practical application in the function of students’ terminology acquisition.",

In this discussion article, we explore three issues and tensions we experienced during a 2‐year research–practice partnership overhauling Tier II high school reading intervention practices in a district serving largely African American students. First, we discuss assessment and the challenges of using data and reading theory to simultaneously address system‐level and student‐level needs. Second, we share our process for choosing a curriculum and evaluating its effectiveness. Finally, we weigh how students' African American English may have been related to program implementation and foundational skills development. We share our takeaways to help practitioners and researchers seeking systematic foundational skills improvement across a district, especially districts like ours.",

        "abstract": "The textual adversarial attack refers to an attack method in which the attacker adds imperceptible perturbations to the original texts by elaborate design so that the NLP (natural language processing) model produces false judgments. This method is also used to evaluate the robustness of NLP models. Currently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages. Textual adversarial attacks are a new challenge for the information processing of Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a Tibetan syllable-level black-box textual adversarial attack called TSAttacker based on syllable cosine distance and scoring mechanism. And then, we conduct TSAttacker on six models generated by fine-tuning two PLMs (pre-trained language models) for three downstream tasks. The experiment results show that TSAttacker is effective and generates high-quality adversarial samples. In addition, the robustness of the involved models still has much room for improvement.",

        "abstract": "Background Understanding the prevalence of diseases and where it is detected and recorded in healthcare settings is important for planning effective prevention and care provision. We examined inequalities in the prevalence of 205 chronic conditions and in the care setting where the related diagnoses were recorded in the English National Health Service. Methods We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum linked with Hospital Episode Statistics for 12.8 million patients registered with 1406 general practices in 2018. We mapped diagnoses recorded in primary and secondary care in the previous 12 years. We used linear regressions to assess associations of ethnicity, deprivation, and general practice with a diagnosis being recorded in primary care only, secondary care only, or both settings. Results 72.65% of patients had at least one diagnosis recorded in any care setting. Most diagnoses were reported only in primary care (62.56%) and a minority only in secondary care (15.24%) or in both settings (22.18%). Black (− 0.08 percentage points (pp)), Asian (− 0.08 pp), mixed (− 0.13 pp), and other ethnicity patients (− 0.31 pp) were less likely than White patients to have a condition recorded. Patients in most deprived areas were 0.27 pp more likely to have a condition recorded (+ 0.07 pp in secondary care only, + 0.10 pp in both primary and secondary care, and + 0.10 pp in primary care only). Differences in prevalence by ethnicity were driven by diagnostic recording in primary care. Higher recording of diagnoses in more deprived areas was consistent across care settings. There were large differences in prevalence and diagnostic recording between general practices after adjusting for patient characteristics. Conclusions Linked primary and secondary care records support the identification of disease prevalence more comprehensively. There are inequalities in the prevalence and setting of diagnostic recording by ethnicity, deprivation, and providers on average across conditions. Further research should examine inequalities for each specific condition and whether they reflect also differences in access or recording as well as disease burden. Improving recording where needed and making national linked records accessible for research are key to understanding and reducing inequalities in disease prevention and management.

        "abstract": "Abstract The point of contact between older immigrants and the formal health system is an area of concern for providers, policy makers and researchers. The challenges that often appear in any interaction between older adults and formal providers are exacerbated when the older person is an immigrant because of language and cultural differences, challenges in a family where migration has taken place, and lack of familiarity with the local system for providing care. Attempts to understand these interactions require attention to two sources of diversity – on the one hand the place of origin of the older migrant and all the social, cultural and policy differences in the places of origin on the one hand and the diversity of types of encounters (ambulatory, emergency department, in-patient hospital) with the formal system and the related issues of insurance status on the other. Our study, using data on encounters between persons speaking Chinese, Spanish or Russian to examine use of the three types of encounters to examine patterns of service use for persons with similar health insurance and primary diagnoses. We will focus on the Chinese speakers and their distinctive pattern of use of formal health service compared to the other groups (Including white and Black English speakers). This is especially true in the lower rate of using emergency departments compared to the other groups. We will also address the challenges to studying immigrant experience in health settings when only language of interaction and not place of birth are collected by health providers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Amyloid imaging biomarkers serve an increasingly important role in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and determining eligibility for treatment with new disease‐modifying therapies. Yet, psychological and behavioral reactions to receiving a biomarker informed diagnosis remain relatively unstudied, especially in diverse and underserved populations where the burden of disease is high and resources for support are often insufficient. We developed the Patient And family member Reactions to biomarker‐informed ADRD DiagnosEs (PARADE) Study to address two key gaps in our understanding: 1) the range and trajectory of psychological and behavioral responses to a biomarker informed diagnosis and 2) the support needs of these individuals and their families. Method Leveraging the infrastructure of New IDEAS, a coverage with evidence development study of amyloid PET, we developed a longitudinal study to quantify responses to receiving an amyloid PET biomarker test as part of a clinical work up for a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Patients enrolled in the New IDEAS study are referred through the Alzheimer’s Association’s TrialMatch and then invited to participate with their study partners in 4 remote structured interviews performed prior to their amyloid PET scan and then 4‐, 12‐, and 24‐weeks after result disclosure. The primary outcome of the study is the Impact of Events Scale (IES), a measure of intrusive thoughts. Along with the IES, the interviews include questionnaires to assess the “value of knowing”, anxiety, depression, social support, loneliness, coping style, and discrimination. The goal of the study is to enroll 500 English or Spanish speaking dyads residing in the continental US. We will oversample Latinx and Black/African American participants as a reflection of the New IDEAS population. Result Data collection began in May 2023 at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, Irvine and is expected to be complete the fourth quarter of 2026. Interviews have been completed by telephone and video conference in Spanish and English with relatively low rates of attrition. Conclusion As the field advances to improve diagnosis and treatment, data from studies like this one will be essential to better understanding the patient and family experience of receiving a biomarker informed diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Healthy dietary behaviors (e.g., low-salt diet) are a critical element of self-care and the cornerstone in managing diabetes and/or hypertension. Social determinants (e.g., cultural preferences and social support) influence dietary behaviors. However, little is known about the influence of social determinants on dietary behaviors of African immigrants living with diabetes and/or hypertension accounting for their level of acculturation. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study of a purposive sample of 24 self-identified sub-Saharan African immigrant adults in the Northeastern U.S. with symptomatic hypertension and/or diabetes who spoke and understood English. Based on scores from the Short Acculturation Scale, African immigrants were classified as more or less acculturated. The sample was mainly Nigerian (75%) and males (67%), with a mean age of 59 years [40-72]. The sample was highly educated, acculturated, employed, and reported having enough income to meet their needs. Compared to more-acculturated immigrants, less-acculturated immigrants regularly ate more African or “traditional food,” vegetables and rice, and avoided salt and fatty/fast/processed American foods. Less-acculturated immigrants cooked their meals and learned their diets from previous education or their workplace. Compared to the less acculturated, more acculturated participants ate fruits regularly and avoided meat or red meat. Interestingly, the more acculturated participants reported learning about their diet from family and friends and noted that family members cook the meals in their household. Interventions to promote healthy diets among immigrants should take into consideration cultural dietary preferences, influence of family, friends, and non-familial social connections, and level of acculturation.",

        "abstract": "Overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a global challenge, leading to prolonged waiting times and adverse patient outcomes. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising solution, enabling remote consultation, triage, and real-time specialist input. Despite its growing application, limited systematic research exists on its specific role in ED triage and care. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions in ED settings, focusing on diagnostic accuracy, patient satisfaction, throughput times, and re-admission rates. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases was conducted up to November 10, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English that assessed telemedicine in ED settings. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using the modified Downs and Black scale. Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that telemedicine improved diagnostic accuracy, reduced re-consultation rates, and enhanced treatment adherence. High diagnostic concordance with in-person assessments was observed, particularly in non-critical cases. Several studies reported shorter throughput times and higher patient satisfaction with telemedicine compared to traditional care. However, telemedicine's impact on high-acuity cases, such as emergency airway management, was less pronounced. Limitations included small sample sizes and the inability to blind participants, which may have influenced outcomes. Telemedicine holds significant potential to improve ED triage and care in non-critical cases, reducing waiting times and enhancing patient outcomes. Further research is needed to establish its efficacy in high-acuity settings and address challenges related to infrastructure and privacy. Telemedicine should complement in-person care as part of an integrated ED strategy.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early prediction is the need of the hour so that interventions like aspirin prophylaxis can be started. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to predict the disease and its prognosis. This review explores the methodologies, predictors, and performance of ML models for preeclampsia prediction, emphasizing their comparative advantages, challenges, and clinical applicability. We conducted a systematic search of databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus for studies published in the last 10 years using terms such as “preeclampsia”, “risk factors”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, and “deep learning”. Words and phrases were selected using MeSH, a controlled vocabulary. Appropriate articles were selected using Boolean operators “OR” and “AND”. The database search yielded 325 records. After removing duplicates and non-English articles, and completing a title and abstract search 55 research articles were assessed for eligibility of which 11 were included in this review. The risk of bias was found to be high in three of the studies and low in the rest. Clinicodemographic characteristics, laboratory reports, Doppler ultrasound, and some innovative ones like genotypic data and fundal images were predictors used to train ML models. More than ten different ML models were used in the 11 studies from diverse countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Korea. The area under the curve varied from 0.76 to 0.97. ML algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and neural networks consistently demonstrated superior predictive accuracy Non-interpretable or black box ML models may not find clinical application on ethical grounds. The future of preeclampsia prediction using ML lies in balancing model performance with interpretability. Human oversight remains indispensable in implementing and interpreting these models to achieve better maternal outcomes. Further research and validation across diverse populations are critical to establishing the universal applicability of these promising ML-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Poor sleep health has been associated with worse cognitive and health outcomes in older adults. Less is known about this relationship in midlife. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between self‐reported sleep health, cognitive function, and performance on common health tasks among middle‐aged adults, as sleep may be a modifiable target to address later life risk of cognitive decline. Method English‐speaking adults aged 35‐64 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health centers in the greater Chicagoland area. Multidimensional sleep health (regularity, satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration) was measured by the RU‐SATED questionnaire. Global cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); age‐ and education‐adjusted Z‐scores were calculated. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA Z‐score lower than one standard deviation below population mean. Performance on common health tasks (e.g. comprehension of print health material, recall of spoken instructions, dosing medications, recall of multimedia education) were assessed using the Comprehensive Health Activities Scale (CHAS). We examined the association between sleep health, cognitive impairment, and health task performance using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Covariates, selected a priori, included age, sex, number of chronic conditions, and depressive symptoms. Result A total of 310 participants (mean age 51.2 ± 8.1; 66% female; 39% non‐Hispanic Black, 32% non‐Hispanic White, 21% Hispanic; 54% with 2+ chronic conditions) were included in analyses. The median sleep health score was 8 (interquartile range: 6‐10) and cognitive impairment was found in 11.3%. Poorer sleep health was significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting for a priori covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96‐0.99; P = 0.007). Both poorer sleep health (ß, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.22‐1.99; P = 0.014) and cognitive impairment (ß, ‐27.7; CI, (‐34.3)‐(‐21.1); P<0.001) were independently associated with poorer performance on health tasks, after adjusting for a priori covariates. Conclusion Poorer self‐reported sleep health in midlife was associated with a greater likelihood of cognitive impairment, whereas both poorer sleep health and cognitive impairment were associated with lower self‐management abilities to navigate healthcare. Future studies should examine whether sleep‐targeted intervention in midlife can mitigate cognitive later‐life decline and poorer health outcomes.",

        "title": "Lifestyle Factors’ Influence on Episodic Memory: A Gradient Boosted Tree Analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Comprehending the role of participatory lifestyle factors influencing the aging process and subsequent cognitive outcomes is imperative for postulating ways to combat cognitive decline. Recent research points to the independent impacts of leisure time activities (LTAs), physical performance (measures of physical fitness) and socialization (relationships and interaction frequency) on healthy cognitive aging, although the relative importance of this triad of factors is poorly delineated. Method From baseline data of two studies examining cognitive aging in older, diverse populations— “Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans” and “Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences,” we scraped subjects’ self‐reported data and Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS) measured cognitive performance scores. Lifestyle survey questions revealed features that well‐represented each category in the triad. These features were used as model inputs, along with sex, education, and income. The cohort consisted of n = 1684 subjects, each characterized by 23 features, after removal for missingness. We applied a grid search algorithm with 5‐fold cross‐validation to tune the hyperparameters of a gradient boosted decision tree model. Optimized for accuracy and generalizability, these parameters defined the model to predict episodic memory scores. Per prediction, relative feature importances were computed as Shapley values. Mean absolute importances (global importance) for the full cohort were derived from the relative values. For triad comparison, summated global importance of the features for each lifestyle category was calculated. Result Group importance ranking revealed aggregated LTAs with the largest contribution to episodic scores, followed by physical performance, then socialization. Notable LTAs included complex cooking, taking classes, and gaming. Although no individual mean absolute feature importance surpassed that of sex, the aggregate importance of the LTA and physical performance groups did; all categories exceeded education and income. Conclusion Our major finding indicates that, beyond the typical factors of interest for episodic memory and healthy cognitive aging, the way one spends their free‐time has a strong association with these outcomes, and suggests LTAs are the most important. It’s worth noting that these three domains may overlap (ex. recreational sporting activities). This research may influence public health guidelines for promoting healthy cognitive aging.",

However, little is known about the relationship between HL, BPV, and domain‐specific cognitive decline. We aimed to examine this relationship among primary care older adults. Method English‐speaking adults aged 55‐74 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health centers in Chicago between 8/2008 and 6/2010. HL was measured by the Newest Vital Sign. BPV was assessed by variation independent of mean systolic blood pressure calculated from all blood pressure measures obtained during routine ambulatory visits that occurred in calendar years 2008 – 2012. Five cognitive domains (processing speed, inductive reasoning, and working, long‐term, and prospective memories) were assessed through 15 tests at baseline, which were repeated three additional times at a 2.5‐year interval. Changes in Z‐scores were calculated from baseline (T1) to the last available assessment (T4 or T3) for each of the five cognitive domains. We examined associations between BPV and domain‐specific cognitive changes with univariate and multivariable regression, adjusting for a priori covariates including baseline age, sex, race, hypertension, number of chronic conditions excluding hypertension, cognitive function, HL, and interval between cognitive assessments. Result A total of 299 participants (age 63.3 ± 5.3; 73% female; 26% non‐Hispanic Black, 67% non‐Hispanic White; 1.8 ± 1.3 chronic conditions; 51.8% with hypertension at baseline) were included in analyses (Table 1).

        "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, Colorado State University Extension (CSUE) has focused on meeting the needs of historically marginalized communities with the highest rates of health disparities and social isolation. These disparities are largely due to language barriers and gaps in cultural competencies among healthcare providers. To bring healthy aging education and support to culturally diverse and underserved communities, CSUE led the adaptation of National Council on Aging’s (NCOA) Aging Mastery Program (AMP), a ten-session evidence-based curriculum (available in both English and Spanish) that supports older adults in aging well. The adaptation of AMP was implemented with Native American, Spanish-dominant immigrant, and East African refugee populations in Colorado. To adapt the program, we utilized state data to identify priority communities. Next, we conducted listening sessions to understand each community’s unique perspectives with a significant focus on developing trusting relationships. We then identified and supported members of each community as champions to teach the curriculum with CSUE’s coaching and technical assistance. Finally, we empowered these champions and their class participants to identify other gaps in knowledge and areas of interest, creating opportunities to develop ‘booster’ sessions. We prioritized paying our community champions to teach and lead in their communities. As a result, we’ve co-written grants and papers and created new programs alongside these champions. We are currently exploring expanding AMP in eight new communities across Colorado. Our program adaptation process has helped to break down barriers to implementing culturally relevant programs with underserved communities while bridging health equity gaps across the state.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Few studies have assessed the relationships between language, race, and code status in a PICU. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify whether non-English language preference (NELP) or race was associated with code status in a PICU. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of 45,143 patients admitted to the PICU between January 2013 and December 2022, excluding those with pre-PICU do not resuscitate (DNR) orders. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two separate exposures were tested simultaneously (NELP and race/ethnicity) for association with the primary outcome of placement of a DNR order in the PICU (logistic regression). The secondary outcome was time to DNR order in patients in whom DNR orders were placed (Cox regression). Potential confounders were age, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III at 12 hours score, religion, admission diagnosis, and hospital length of stay before PICU admission. RESULTS: Patients with Spanish-preference, Arabic-preference, or other NELP had higher odds of having a DNR order placed during PICU admission relative to English-preference (all adjusted odds ratios [aORs] between 1.81 and 3.59; all p < 0.001). Among patients with a DNR, Other NELP patients had faster times to DNR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30–2.39; p < 0.001). Non-Hispanic Black patients consistently had lower odds of having a DNR order relative to non-Hispanic White patients (aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.91; p = 0.002). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with NELP had higher odds of having a new DNR order placed in the PICU, whereas non-Hispanic Black patients had lower odds. NELP may be correlated with unmeasured illness severity, thereby confounding the relationship between language and probability of DNR. However, our data support that demographic factors, such as Black race, are strong predictors of a change in code status to DNR and time to DNR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Gender differences are often associated with specific cognitive domains. Additionally, gender may be associated with BMI through biological and social differences. We evaluated if mid‐life BMI mediated the effect of gender on domain specific cognition in an ethnoracially diverse population of individuals 80+. Method Data from three ongoing cohort studies, LifeAfter90, Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences, and Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans, was pooled to include participants aged 80+ (n = 671). Baseline verbal episodic memory (VEM), executive function (EF), and semantic memory (SM) were measured using the z‐standardized Spanish English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. Mid‐life BMI was categorized as normal (18.5‐24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25‐29.9 kg/m2), and obese (30 kg/m2) using the first clinical measurement at ages 40‐60. Structural equation models were used to estimate the indirect effect (IDE) of mid‐life BMI category on the association between gender and cognition adjusting for age at baseline cognitive assessment, age at BMI measurement, racial/ethnic identity, and education. Result Participants were 37% male, 17% Asian, 35% Black, 12% Latino, 33% White, 3% other racial/ethnic group with a mean age of 88.5±5.3 at baseline cognitive assessment and a mean age at mid‐life BMI measure of 44.6±4.3 years (table 1). Midlife obesity (9%) and overweight (31%) were common. The total effect of gender (ref = women) on each cognitive domain was significant (VEM: ‐0.19, p < 0.001; EF: ‐0.12, p = 0.001; SM: 0.202, p < 0.001). Five percent (p‐value = 0.07) of the association between gender and VEM was explained by BMI category (IDE (β = ‐0.01; p‐value = 0.06) divided by total effect (β = ‐0.19; (p‐value<0.001); Figure 1). BMI did not mediate the association between gender and SM (β(IDE) = ‐0.003;p‐value = 0.29) or between gender and EF (β(IDE) = ‐0.005; p‐value = 0.19). Conclusion In this ethnoracially diverse population of individuals aged 80+, mid‐life BMI marginally mediated the association between gender and baseline VEM, while it did not mediate the associations with EF and SM. Additionally, men had lower EF and VEM but higher SM compared to women. The effect of mid‐life BMI on the association between gender and cognition may vary by cognitive domain, suggesting that mid‐life BMI may impact specific late‐life cognitive functions that are associated with VEM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objectives As artificial intelligence evolves, integrating speech processing into home healthcare (HHC) workflows is increasingly feasible. Audio-recorded communications enhance risk identification models, with automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as a key component. This study evaluates the transcription accuracy and equity of 4 ASR systems—Amazon Web Services (AWS) General, AWS Medical, Whisper, and Wave2Vec—in transcribing patient-nurse communication in US HHC, focusing on their ability in accurate transcription of speech from Black and White English-speaking patients. Materials and Methods We analyzed audio recordings of patient-nurse encounters from 35 patients (16 Black and 19 White) in a New York City-based HHC service. Overall, 860 utterances were available for study, including 475 drawn from Black patients and 385 from White patients. Automatic speech recognition performance was measured using word error rate (WER), benchmarked against a manual gold standard. Disparities were assessed by comparing ASR performance across racial groups using the linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) tool, focusing on 10 linguistic dimensions, as well as specific speech elements including repetition, filler words, and proper nouns (medical and nonmedical terms). Results The average age of participants was 67.8 years (SD = 14.4). Communication lasted an average of 15 minutes (range: 11-21 minutes) with a median of 1186 words per patient. Of 860 total utterances, 475 were from Black patients and 385 from White patients. Amazon Web Services General had the highest accuracy, with a median WER of 39%. However, all systems showed reduced accuracy for Black patients, with significant discrepancies in LIWC dimensions such as “Affect,” “Social,” and “Drives.” Amazon Web Services Medical performed best for medical terms, though all systems have difficulties with filler words, repetition, and nonmedical terms, with AWS General showing the lowest error rates at 65%, 64%, and 53%, respectively. Discussion While AWS systems demonstrated superior accuracy, significant disparities by race highlight the need for more diverse training datasets and improved dialect sensitivity. Addressing these disparities is critical for ensuring equitable ASR performance in HHC settings and enhancing risk prediction models through audio-recorded communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Social determinants of health have been associated with disparities in health outcomes, including cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. While individual‐level disparities have been characterized, more research is needed into structural social determinants of health (SSDoH) and their association with cognitive outcomes, especially for those in midlife. This study aimed to investigate the association between SSDoH and subjective and objective measures of cognitive impairment. Methods English‐speaking adults ages 35‐64 were recruited from an academic general internal medicine practice and federally qualified health network in the Chicagoland area. SSDoH was evaluated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a validated factor‐based index of neighborhood socioeconomic context using participant census block, then divided into terciles with the highest tercile indicating highest neighborhood deprivation. Subjective cognitive concern was measured by a single question assessing concern about cognitive or memory issues as part of the Everyday Cognition Cog scales. Objective cognition was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with MoCA < 23 (out of 30) indicating cognitive impairment. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to characterize the relationship between SSDoH and cognitive impairment, including a priori covariates of age, sex, education, and number of chronic conditions. Results A total of 596 participants (age 52±8; 64% female; 42% non‐Hispanic Black, 34% non‐Hispanic White, 16% Hispanic; 62% college graduate) were included in the analysis. Younger age, female sex, non‐Hispanic Black race, and lower education and income were associated with higher ADI (Table 1). One‐third of participants (34%) reported subjective cognitive concern, whereas objective cognitive impairment was found in 22.6%. Compared to the lowest ADI tercile (i.e. least deprived), the highest ADI tercile (i.e. most deprived) was significantly associated with objective cognitive impairment (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5‐5.9; p = 0.001) but not subjective cognitive concerns (aOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7‐2.0; p = 0.46), after adjusting for a priori covariates (Table 2). Conclusions Neighborhood deprivation is associated with Future research should investigate the possible mechanisms of this association to identify optimal interventions at the neighborhood level.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Certain air pollutants have carcinogenic and estrogenic properties that can contribute to breast cancer development. This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and breast cancer based on epidemiological evidence. This systematic review included articles published between 2013 and 2022 from Scopus and PubMed databases, focusing on cohort and nested case-control studies examining the association between outdoor air pollution and breast cancer. A total of 25 articles were included. A total of eight outdoor pollutants were analyzed, with seven showing a significant association with breast cancer risk. Specifically, the strong association between benzo[a]pyrene and breast cancer risk was reported. Furthermore, all four studies on nitrogen oxides (NOx), fifteen out of eighteen (83.33%) on particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), nine out of thirteen studies (69.23%) on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and three out of seven studies (42.86%) on particulate matter less than 10 µm PM10 showed an association with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05–1.56; odds ratio [OR]: 1.03–1.86). In contrast, only one out of three studies (33.33%) on O3 (HR: 0.76–1.03) and all studies on cadmium (OR: 0.88–0.97) suggested a negative association with breast cancer risk. None of the studies on black carbon found an association with breast cancer risk. It is important to note the methodological limitations of this review, including potential publication bias due to the inclusion of only English-language articles and a regional focus on developed countries, which may limit the generalizability of findings. This study suggests that exposure to outdoor air pollutants is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship and the mechanisms by which environmental pollutants may trigger carcinogenic effects and contribute to breast cancer development through epigenetic pathways.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To summarise the evidence regarding the prevalence of anxiety and depression in former elite athletes compared with the general population. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and SPORTDiscus) were searched from 1970 to 2023. Eligibility criteria Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they: (1) were written in English; (2) included male or female elite athletes that had been retired ≥1 year; (3) included a control group or population reference values; (4) reported the time-point prevalence of anxiety and/or depression; and (5) were of a retrospective, longitudinal or prospective, methodological design. A modified version of the Downs and Black tool was used to determine risk of bias. Results 37 unique studies including 24 732 former athletes (2% female) were included in the meta-analysis. The time-point prevalence of anxiety (prevalence ratio (PR): 2.08 (95% CI 1.57 to 2.60)) and depression (PR: 2.58 (95% CI 2.04 to 3.12)) in former athletes was over twice that of the general population. Subgroup analyses revealed former American football players and jockeys had the highest time-point prevalence of both anxiety and depression (PR: 2.24–2.88), whereas the time-point prevalence of depression and anxiety was not significantly different to the general population for former rugby players (PR: 1.13–1.30). Conclusion Our meta-analyses demonstrated the time-point prevalence of anxiety and depression in former elite athletes could be over twice that of the general population, with sport-specific differences evident.

Each of the book’s four sections meditates on a particular aspect of these contradictions, unpacking how certain intellectual projects and submerged knowledges cannot be understood in “disciplined English.” These stylistic choices function on both a creative and critical level, leaving us with a text that will challenge a wide range of audiences across the humanities and be instructive in our classrooms and workshops.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Limited information is available for evidence supported psychological treatment options for pain in minority populations. The purposes of this scoping review were to determine if psychological treatments were 1) evaluated for minority populations; 2) if minorities were sufficiently included in clinical trials 3) if there were trials that were specific to minority populations. A search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases for psychological interventions for pain in older adults over the age of 50. We also searched review articles. Search terms were chronic pain OR pain; older adults OR elderly OR geriatric OR aged OR human; pain management OR nonpharmacological pain management OR intervention OR psychotherapy; randomized control trial. Papers had to be in English, a randomized clinical trial, with pain as the primary outcome, and the treatment had to be a psychological intervention. We coded studies that had at least a 90% minority sample as a trial specific to a minority population or if one of the groups was minority. From 14,000 studies identified by the search, we reviewed 485 full texts. Of those,129 psychological interventions studies on older adults with chronic pain met inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 6 African-American, 7 Asian,1 Turkish, and 2 Iranian samples. Studies represented 24 countries. However, 72 studies did not provide enough information about ethnicity or race. The lack of reporting of race and ethnicity took place across many disciplines and journal types. All journals should require reporting ethnic and racial demographics of participants to increase generalizability of findings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background The Good Life program for healthy brain aging (TGL) is an online program for positive lifestyle change that is made up of exercise, diet and social support classes. Since 2020, The Good Life has served thousands of older Californians. Currently, we host 17 classes weekly for our 750 active members (in both English and Spanish). Our exercise and cooking classes are our most watched content. Exercise classes attendance is 20‐70 participants per show (x11 weekly). Our x3/week cooking classes attendance is 20‐50 participants per show. We provide The Good Life freely and, in the process, engender goodwill ‐ a proven pathway to rebuilding trust and fostering reciprocity. The Good Life enjoys funding support from the State of California as public health program to support Black and Latinx healthy aging. In 2023 it expanded broadly across 13 California counties participating in the CDC’s Healthy Bain Initiative, providing TGL to all California residents. Three of the 13 counties are now creating local content tailor made to their specific ethno‐geographies. Method TGL is implementing a 9‐step infrastructure building plan to (1) Extend this California program to scale nationally to serve large numbers of participants in NIA clinical research and training network centers; (2) Engage Black and Latinx American communities across the nation in a thoughtful, fun, and clinically meaningful health education campaign with messaging that will facilitate recruitment and enhance retention; (3) Evaluate the success of our precision engagement program using empirical metrics: (i) participant enrollment into clinical trials, (ii) time spent watching content per digital segment, (iii) number of clicks into subsequent public health messaging. These metrics will be correlated with participant data describing changes in attitudes re (a) Trust in Biomedical Research and (b) Stages of Research Volunteerism. Result Since May 2023, TGL has recruited 260 Black Americans into 3 academic clinical research programs. Conclusion TGL is a scalable internet‐based program with potential reach well beyond its large existing membership.",

        "title": "Midlife Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Cognitive Decline in a Diverse Cohort of Adults Ages 80 and Older",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Midlife cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) are associated with late‐life cognitive impairment, but also mortality. We evaluated their association with cognitive decline in a diverse cohort of older adults who survived to age 80 without diagnosis of dementia. Method Three harmonized cohorts of long‐term Kaiser Permanente members were pooled and restricted to those aged 80+. We measured CVRF from Multiphasic Health Check‐ups (MHC; 1964‐1985), which assessed hyperlipidemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, diabetes, and smoking status. Standardized z‐scores for executive function (EF) and verbal episodic memory (VEM) were measured over up to 8 waves (2017‐2023) using the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. Linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes associated CVRF, separately, with cognitive decline adjusting for age at MHC, age at cognitive assessment, race (Asian/Black/Latino/white/multiracial), education (≤high school/some college/≤college), assessment mode (in‐person/telephone), and practice effects. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the count of CVD risk factors stratified by smoking status. Result Participants (n = 935) averaged 40.6(±7.9) years of age at MHC, 88.0(±4.9) years at baseline cognitive assessment, and 61.4% were women (Table 1). At midlife, 47% had hyperlipidemia, 23% hypertension, 34% overweight/obese, 1% diabetes, and 51% ever smoked. Hyperlipidemia was associated with worse baseline EF (β(95% CI):‐0.24(‐0.36,‐0.12)), smoking was associated with better EF (β:0.13(0.01,0.25)), and hypertension was associated with worse EF (β:‐0.14(‐0.25, 0.002)), though the effect was not statistically significant (Table 2). There were no associations between CVRF and EF decline. Hyperlipidemia was the only CVRF associated with worse baseline VEM (β:‐0.18(‐0.31,‐0.05)), and no CVRF was associated with VEM decline (Table 2). Despite smokers having higher baseline EF compared to nonsmokers, having 3+ CVRF was associated with steeper decline in both groups compared to those with fewer CVRF (Figure 1). Baseline VEM was similar between smokers and non‐smokers, and for both smokers and nonsmokers, the steepest declines in VEM were among those with one CVRF. Conclusion In this diverse cohort, midlife hyperlipidemia was associated with worse cognition in late life. A positive association between smoking and EF may be indicative of resilience among midlife smokers who have reached age 80+. Regardless of smoking status, multiple CVD risk factors may be detrimental to cognitive function, particularly EF.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Studies are limited regarding the role of intersectional social determinants of health in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology (ADNP). Method We analyzed data on 3,107 participants in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Neuropathology Dataset who had a visit ≤24 months before autopsy and confirmed ADNP (moderate to frequent neuritic plaques and Braak Stage III‐VI). Groups were defined based on the presence (symptomatic ADNP, n = 2,956) or absence (asymptomatic ADNP, n = 151) of an MCI/dementia diagnosis at the final visit before death. Social determinants included gender (man/women), educational attainment (years), racialized group (Black, White, other), Hispanic ethnicity, living alone, and English/non‐English primary language. Multivariable logistic regression tested associations between these determinants and ADNP classification (asymptomatic vs symptomatic), and additionally, the models were stratified by gender. Models controlled for age at death, apolipoprotein e4 carrier status, informant‐reported memory decline, time between last visit and autopsy, vascular and Lewy body pathology, and comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, depression). Results Women (versus men) were more likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00‐1.03), as were those with greater years of education (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.004‐1.006), Hispanic individuals (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03‐1.11), and those living alone (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06‐1.17). Non‐English primary language speakers were less likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85‐0.92). Gender‐stratified analyses showed that both women and men were more likely to have asymptomatic ADNP if they were Hispanic (women: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02‐1.11; men: OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.08) or living alone (women: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07‐1.18; men: OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02‐1.18). Women speaking a non‐English primary language were less likely to have asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83‐0.91), while in men, more years of education was associated with greater odds of asymptomatic ADNP (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.002‐1.007). Conclusion Our study suggests that gender, education, Hispanic ethnicity, primary language, and living alone, as well as the intersectionality of these factors with gender, may differentially influence MCI/dementia diagnosis prior to death in the presence of ADNP. These findings emphasize the need for future Alzheimer’s disease research to prioritize intersectional social determinants of brain health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Healthy dietary behaviors (e.g., low-salt diet) are a critical element of self-care and the cornerstone in managing diabetes and/or hypertension. Social determinants (e.g., cultural preferences and social support) influence dietary behaviors. However, little is known about the influence of social determinants on dietary behaviors of African immigrants living with diabetes and/or hypertension accounting for their level of acculturation. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study of a purposive sample of 24 self-identified sub-Saharan African immigrant adults in the Northeastern U.S. with symptomatic hypertension and/or diabetes who spoke and understood English. Based on scores from the Short Acculturation Scale, African immigrants were classified as more or less acculturated. The sample was mainly Nigerian (75%) and males (67%), with a mean age of 59 years [40-72]. The sample was highly educated, acculturated, employed, and reported having enough income to meet their needs. Compared to more-acculturated immigrants, less-acculturated immigrants regularly ate more African or “traditional food,” vegetables and rice, and avoided salt and fatty/fast/processed American foods. Less-acculturated immigrants cooked their meals and learned their diets from previous education or their workplace. Compared to the less acculturated, more acculturated participants ate fruits regularly and avoided meat or red meat. Interestingly, the more acculturated participants reported learning about their diet from family and friends and noted that family members cook the meals in their household. Interventions to promote healthy diets among immigrants should take into consideration cultural dietary preferences, influence of family, friends, and non-familial social connections, and level of acculturation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive impairment (CI) and depression often co-occur, and each is known to impair older adults’ ability to perform activities of daily living. We sought to determine whether co-morbid depression moderates the association of CI with impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We recruited English speaking adults ages ≥55 years without preexisting dementia or CI from primary care practices in New York City and Chicago (n=1,045). IADLs were assessed using Lawton’s 8-item scale and impairment was defined as ≥1 activity requiring assistance. Cognitive function was measured using Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA); moderate-severe CI was defined as MoCA score ≥1.5 standard deviations below the age and education adjusted z-score. Depression was defined as a score ≥10 using Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ)-8. We fit linear regression models estimating the association of mild CI, moderate-severe CI, and depression with counts of IADL impairments, adjusting for age and sex. We then added an interaction term for CI and depression. The mean age was 67 (8.0) years, 54% were female, 35% Black and 25% Hispanic. Median IADL impairments were 0 (IQR 0-7); 16% had mild CI, 5% moderate-severe CI, and 15% had depression. Moderate-severe CI (β=0.84, p< 0.01) and severe depression (β=1.31, p< 0.01) were each independently associated with IADL impairments in the adjusted model. The interaction term of moderate-severe CI with depression was also significant (β -0.85, p < 0.01). Depression significantly worsens the association of CI with IADL impairment, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating this common condition in older adults.",

Adverse lifelong experiences in Vietnam and host countries may have impacted these results. Some refugees who arrived during their youth became health professionals while their children attend universities, predominantly enrolled in pre-health courses. Leveraging their bilingual/bicultural and health background, they have hosted free health fairs for their monolingual older Vietnamese for the past 16 years in Houston, Texas, the 2nd largest Vietnamese-populated city in the nation. Despite the high prevalence of dementia, no free cognitive healthcare has been provided. The purpose of the study is to report the collaborative efforts to fill the gap using the Cultural Exchange Model (CEM) and improve dementia literacy. The CEM teaches that to create knowledge, two constituencies need to merge within the Community. One arm of Vietnamese stakeholders (older adults, medical doctors) already exists. We formed another arm, Cognitive Health Initiative (CHAIN): 28 bilingual/bicultural Vietnamese university students, who were trained in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). During 2023, we jointly attended 11 health fairs with Vietnamese medical professionals and offered 337 MoCA in Vietnamese and English. The results showed that older Vietnamese (≥65) scored the lowest (22.4/30) among participants (White=24.8; Black=23.9; Hispanic=23.3). Utilizing existing, underlying resilience and the unique affinity among local Vietnamese health professionals, our next steps include continuing to offer a “Memory Booth” by local Vietnamese pre-health students, thereby strengthening intergenerational relationships.",

        "abstract": "Background Heat-altered stones (HAS) are commonly reported in prehistoric sites across several continents, yet they continue to be generally overlooked and systematic studies on them are scarce. Methods We performed a systematic literature review which consisted of searching journal articles, book chapters and books published in English, in Scopus and Web of Science. We collected information on their geographic distribution, chronology, composition, technological aspects and subsistence contexts from 73 records. Our aims were to assess the challenges and opportunities of analysing HAS, while highlighting that this class of artefacts is still largely an untapped source of information on prehistoric human activities. Results HAS have been documented since the Pleistocene, attesting that culinary and non-culinary activities using heating stones emerged among foraging groups subsisting on hunting, fishing and gathering. The high frequency of HAS during the middle and late Holocene testifies to the continuation of some practices over long time periods, amid the emergence of new food systems, and the introduction of new resources and technologies, such as domesticated plants and animals, and ceramic containers. A considerable lack of studies on HAS from Africa, Oceania, Asia, and South America was noted, all of which are key geographic areas for assessing the role of heating stones in human evolution, geographic dispersal, early cuisine and diet, and cultural transmission across the globe. Conclusions Our results highlight the persistent challenges archaeologists face in establishing fundamental definitions and diagnostic criteria for identifying HAS, while emphasizing the importance of HAS as essential elements for studying ancient foodways and cultural heritage. We call on archaeologists and cultural heritage managers to reconsider the heritage value of HAS and include them in specialised research agendas before significant knowledge of our past is lost.",

The research proves that the English language variant, adapting to the realities of local languages and cultures, acquires new sociolinguistic properties. The aim of the study is to identify the specifics of such a variant of the English language as the South African English which was formed during the contact interaction of the British English language and the autochthonous languages and cultures of South Africa. The key properties of the South African English are revealed on the basis of methods groups: analysis and synthesis; comparative analysis; and the method of component analysis. The key attention is paid to the historical process formation of South African English and to the development of the English language and its role in the life of South Africa. The complex nature of long-term historical inter language and intercultural interaction has led to the formation of a heterogeneous structure of South African society, is which is presented by Europeans, numerous local peoples, Indians and their descendants living on the same territory. The complex differentiation of South African society has defined a unique variety of languages, dialects, and sociolects, among which English has a special social prestige and unites all other languages. Having a multicomponent structure, sociolinguistic differentiation of South African society contributed to the emergence and functioning a series of South African English variants types in one territory. These types are: Black South African English, White South African English, Coloured South African English. The English language of each sociolinguistic group has unique features that manifest themselves to a greater extent at the phonetic level.",

        "abstract": "The article analyzes the emergence of European values in the concepts of philosophers of Ancient Greece and state thinkers of Ancient Rome. \nThe author shows their further development under the influence of Christianity, social church doctrine, ideas of German classical philosophers, thinkers of the Enlightenment, and founders of the concept of natural law.The significance of the first European documents on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the Magna Charta of 1215, the Habeas Corpus of 1679, the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, the first constitutions in Europe, and the US Constitution (1787) are studied. The study of the genesis of the values on which the EU is based today takes into account the development of the Ukrainian state and law and their impact on this process, in particular the establishment of Greek city-states in the Southern Black Sea region, the introduction of Christianity in Kyivan Rus. The significance of the documents and treaties of Kyivan Rus and the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk (1710) in terms of their compliance with the values of the EU and their influence on their formation is clarified. Particular attention is paid to the evolution of EU values after the conclusion of the 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms within the framework of the Council of Europe and the creation of the European Communities. The author analyzes the texts of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (1951), the Treaty on the European Economic Community (1957), and the Single European Act (1986).The transformation of EU values and their legal nature from the Draft Treaty on a Constitution for Europe (2003) to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2001), which became part of the Lisbon Treaty (2009), is studied in more detail. Special attention is paid to the evolution of legal terminology in EU law, when the term «principles» is still used in the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the term «values» is used in the text of the Treaty of Lisbon. The author shows how values developed from philosophical, concepts, under the influence of religious and political teachings, supplemented and transformed in EU law from legal principles to values. In the final part of the article, conclusions are formulated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background People of African and Caribbean heritage in the UK have a higher prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and poorer health outcomes than white Europeans. Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles for Diabetes Online (HEAL‐D Online) is a co‐designed, culturally tailored T2D self‐management programme for black African and Caribbean adults, which, due to online delivery, is well positioned for spread. This qualitative evaluation uses the Exploration‐Preparation‐Implementation‐Sustainment (EPIS) framework to explore factors affecting scale‐up from delivery and commissioning perspectives. Methods Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with nine commissioners and providers of T2D services from three English areas with varying population characteristics to explore scale‐up. Focus groups were held with 15 people of African and Caribbean heritage with T2D lived experience to explore the impact of a digital model of participation. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, with themes mapped onto the EPIS framework exploration phase constructs to consider the outer and inner contextual factors for planning implementation. Results Six EPIS constructs were identified by commissioners and providers as key in scaling HEAL‐D Online. People with T2D lived experience explored the online mode of delivery, using the patient advocacy construct as the analytical lens. In delivering an online T2D programme, two themes were identified: (1) aligning course content with people's preferences; (2) practicalities to ensure online delivery was acceptable and accessible to the community. Conclusions HEAL‐D Online was acceptable with the potential to help address health inequalities. The EPIS framework provided a structure to understand factors in planning scale‐up for an intervention targeting underserved communities.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate trends and inequalities in statin use for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) Design Repeated cross-sectional and historical cohort study designs Setting English primary care electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD Aurum) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care Participants 5 million adults aged 25 years and older randomly sampled from CPRD Aurum between 1st April 2009 and 31st December 2021. Outcome measures Monthly proportion of current statin users; adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for statin initiation; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for cardiovascular risk assessment, statin discontinuation and statin re-initiation and number of CVD events prevented with optimal statin use and estimated costs saved. Results The overall monthly proportion of individuals prescribed statins for primary prevention increased from 22.3% in 2009 to 35.6% in 2021 among those aged 70+ years, and was stable in other age groups. The proportion of eligible individuals receiving a statin for secondary prevention was higher in all age groups (e.g. increasing from 68.1% to 73.7% over the same period, in those aged 70+). Overall prevalence of statin use was lowest among women, 25-39 age group, and black, mixed, and other ethnic groups for both primary and secondary prevention. Monthly proportion of CVD risk assessment, among those eligible, increased from 13.7% in May 2009 to 31.8% by November 2021. 79.0% of individuals were initiated statins within 60 days of a CVD event. Women (aOR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.68-0.72) and people of black ethnicity (aOR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77) were less likely to be initiated statins compared to those of white ethnicity while people of south Asian ethnicity (aOR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42-1.64) were more likely to be initiated statins than white people for secondary prevention. Statin discontinuation was most likely among women (aHR 1.08, 95% CI; 1.06-1.11) black people (aHR 1.76, 95% CI, 1.65-1.89) and the most deprived group (aHR 1.08, 95% CI; 1.04-1.12) compared to men, white people and the least deprived group, respectively, for primary prevention with similar associations seen for secondary prevention for ethnicity and deprivation. With optimal statin treatment, over 150,000 cardiovascular events could be prevented in the next 10 years for primary prevention and 5 years for secondary prevention resulting in a potential saving to the health service of over 400 million (GBP) in those eligible for statins. Conclusion Statin use remains suboptimal and inequalities particularly among women, people of black ethnicity and those in the most deprived socioeconomic groups persist across multiple stages of statin use for both primary and secondary prevention. To reduce these inequalities and avoid missed opportunities to prevent cardiovascular events and costs to the NHS, strategies are needed specifically targeting these patient groups to reduce the burden of CVD.",

        "abstract": "Background Anemia due to living condition disproportionally affects the global refugee children. Nutritional deficiency particularly iron deficiency is the primary causes of anemia. Hence, we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of anemia among refugee children. Methods We searched systematically all relevant studies on the prevalence of anemia among refugee children including under the age of 18 years, which were conducted between 2009 and 2023 in English from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochran library and other gray literatures such as google scholar. Two researchers independently screened articles based on their title and abstract. The Joana Brigg’s Institute (JBI) checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. Random effect model was utilized to calculate the pooled estimate of anemia. Higgins I2 statistics and Egger’s test were analyzed to check heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. Subgroup analysis by continent, age group of the children and year of study was employed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Result A total of 14 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Most of the studies were from Asian countries followed by African countries. The pooled prevalence of anemia among global refugee children was 36.54 with (95% CI: 23.79, 49.28). There was moderate level of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 68.91, P<0.001). The highest pooled prevalence of anemia in refugee children was reported in African, it was 56.1%, whereas the lowest pooled prevalence of anemia was in N. America, it was 12.66%. The prevalence of anemia was highest (53.88) in studies done among under-five refugee children. Conclusion The global prevalence of anemia among refugee children is found to be moderate public health problem. Anemia prevalence is more common in African refugee children. Intervention and prevention for should be focused especially for refugees found in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "The article aims at conducting etymological analysis of the English terminology of cybersecurity which\nhas become topical under the conditions of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine and a growing cyberthreat\nto computer networks and applications all over the world. In spite of numerous works on the topic, there\nremains a range of uninvestigated issues concerning the origin of English cybersecurity terms. Cybersecurity\nis defi ned as measures to protect a person, organization or country and their computer information against\ncrime or attacks carried out using the Internet. 450 terms from the Glossary of Cyber Security Terms were\nanalyzed with a help of Online Etymology Dictionary. Methodology of investigation combines structural\nand etymological analyses. As a result of the structural analysis, the terms under study were subdivided into\none-component and multicomponent ones. It was found that three quarters of the studied terms appear to\nbe complex in their structure. The fi ndings of etymological analysis revealed that they are predominantly of\nLatin origin, while the second place among them is shared by the terms of a mixed Latin-Greek and English-\nLatin origin. They are followed in number by word-combinations of Latin origin with both Germanic roots\n(9.3%) and English proper elements (9.3%). The least represented appeared to be the terms of Greek-Italian\nand Greek-Arabic hybrid origin, as well as combinations of American English and Italian. The remaining\n106 one-component terms were also under consideration, among which the Latin-language term elements\nof the cybersecurity system prevail, making up a tenth part of the analyzed material. Other sources of the\nstudied terms (Greek, Dutch, Germanic, Old Norse, Celtic, African, Arabic, and blending) turned out to\nbe considerably less characteristic of the studied material and are represented by only 1–2% of examples\nincluding both direct and indirect borrowings. Thus, the vast majority of the terms studied (76%) are of\nmixed (Greek-Latin-Old English) origin, a tenth of each (10%) are terms of English proper and Germanic\nlanguages, as well as of Latin origin. In conclusion, the outcomes of etymological analysis revealed that\nEnglish terminology of cyber security is predominantly a hybrid mixture of classical Latin-Greek roots with\nEnglish elements.\nKey words: etymology, cybersecurity, terminology, Latin, Greek, one-component terms, multicomponent\nterms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To consolidate clinical trials that utilized the CRISPR technology to synthesise cures for various genetic diseases as a means to provide a window into the progress made so far while paving the way forward for future research and practices. Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023479511). Trials from seven databases’ (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Registry, ISRCTN registry, ICTRP/trialsearch.who.int, ChiCTR.org.cn, Clinical Trial Registry India, and Cochrane Library/Trials) inception to 9 March 2024, were considered. Exclusion criteria were unrelated, duplicated, non-English, unavailable full texts, diagnostic studies, correlational studies, observational studies, abstract-only papers, reviews or conference papers. Included studies were appraised using the ten-item CASP tool to assess methodological quality. The review identified 82 RCTs utilizing CRISPR and revealed four main themes: Diseases targeted, Countries of Clinical trials, Type of interventions, and Trial trends over the years. Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background The 42 days after delivery (“fourth trimester”) are a high-risk period for birthing individuals and newborns, especially those who are racially and ethnically marginalized due to structural racism. Objective To fill a gap in the critical “fourth trimester,” we developed 2 ruled-based chatbots—one for birthing individuals and one for newborn caregivers—that provided trusted information about postbirth warning signs and newborn care and connected patients with health care providers. Methods A total of 4370 individuals received the newborn chatbot outreach between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023, and 3497 individuals received the postpartum chatbot outreach between November 16, 2022, and December 31, 2023. We conducted surveys and interviews in English and Spanish to understand the acceptability and usability of the chatbot and identify areas for improvement. We sampled from hospital discharge lists that distributed the chatbot, stratified by prenatal care location, age, type of insurance, and racial and ethnic group. We analyzed quantitative results using descriptive analyses in SPSS (IBM Corp) and qualitative results using deductive coding in Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants). Results Overall, 2748 (63%) individuals opened the newborn chatbot messaging, and 2244 (64%) individuals opened the postpartum chatbot messaging. A total of 100 patients engaged with the chatbot and provided survey feedback; of those, 40% (n=40) identified as Black, 27% (n=27) identified as Hispanic/Latina, and 18% (n=18) completed the survey in Spanish. Payer distribution was 55% (n=55) for individuals with public insurance, 39% (n=39) for those with commercial insurance, and 2% (n=2) for uninsured individuals. The majority of surveyed participants indicated that chatbot messaging was timely and easy to use (n=80, 80%) and found the reminders to schedule the newborn visit (n=59, 59%) and postpartum visit (n=66, 66%) useful. Across 23 interviews (n=14, 61% Black; n=4, 17% Hispanic/Latina; n=2, 9% in Spanish; n=11, 48% public insurance), 78% (n=18) of interviewees engaged with the chatbot. Interviewees provided positive feedback on usability and content and recommendations for improving the outreach messages. Conclusions Chatbots are a promising strategy to reach birthing individuals and newborn caregivers with information about postpartum recovery and newborn care, but intentional outreach and engagement strategies are needed to optimize interaction. Future work should measure the chatbot’s impact on health outcomes and reduce disparities.",

        "title": "Anti-Black racism in Canadian health care: a qualitative study of diverse perceptions of racism and racial discrimination among Black adults in Montreal, Quebec",
        "abstract": "Background Racism has been shown to impact the health of Black persons through its influence on health care, including its expression through implicit biases in provider training, attitudes, and behaviours. Less is known about the experiences of racism in contexts outside of the USA, and how race and racism interact with other social locations and systems of discrimination to shape Black patients’ experiences of racism in health care encounters. To help address this gap, this study examined diverse Black individuals’ perceived experiences of, and attitudes towards, anti-Black racism and racial discrimination in Canadian health care, specifically in Montreal, Quebec. Methods This descriptive qualitative study adopted a social constructionist approach. Employing purposive maximal variation and snowball sampling strategies, eligible study participants were: self-identified Black persons aged 18 years and older who lived in Montreal during the COVID-19 pandemic, who could speak English or French, and who were registered with the Quebec medical insurance program. In-depth interviews were conducted, and a Framework Analysis approach guided the systematic exploration and interpretation of data using an intersectionality lens. Results We interviewed 32 participants, the majority of whom were women (59%), university educated (69%), and modestly comfortable financially (41%), but diverse in terms of age (22 to 79 years), country of origin, and self-defined ethnicity. We identified five major themes demonstrating substantial variations in perceived racism in health care that are influenced by unique social locations such as gender identity, age, and immigration history: (1) no perceptions of racism in health care, (2) ambiguous perceptions of racism in health care, (3) perceptions of overt interpersonal racism in health care, (4) perceptions of covert interpersonal racism in health care (including the downplaying of health concerns, stereotyping, and racial microaggressions), and (5) perceptions of systemic racism in health care. Conclusions Perceptions of anti-Black racism and racial discrimination in Canadian health care are complex and may include intra-racial group differences. This study begins to address the dearth of empirical research documenting experiences of anti-Black racism in health care in Quebec, highlighting a continued need for serious consideration of the ways in which racism may manifest in the province, as well as a need for anti-racist advocacy. Advancing racial health equity requires greater sensitivity from providers and decision makers to variations in Black patients’ health care experiences, towards ensuring that they have access to high quality and equitable health care services.

        "abstract": "Racism have been directed associated with social discrimination of black women caused by racial exclusion. We aimed to visualize the state-of-the-art black women and social and racial discrimination. A total of 214 English-language publications were analysis, comprising articles, books review, editorial, letter, meeting abstract, proceeding papers and reviews, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database spanning from January 1977 to May 2024. The results revealed: (1) Cultural Diversity & Ethnic minority psychology journal has published the most studies. The University of Michigan and University of California play the most important role in research related to black woman and social and racial discrimination. The USA is the main publishing country with significant academic influence. (2) Seanna Leath, Jioni A Lewis, J Camille Hall are the leading scholars in black women and social and racial discrimination. Regarding local impact per author, using the H-index, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Frontiers in Psychiatry appeared to be the most relevant. (3) The research frontier of black women and social and racial discrimination has significantly shifted from focusing on community, racism, intersectionality, structural racism, and discrimination.",

        "abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tissue flossing on athletic performance measures. A secondary aim was to explore the efficacy of tissue flossing when applied to a joint or soft tissue (i.e., muscle belly) on athletic performance measures. An article search was completed in the PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, SCOPUS, and OneSearch electronic databases up to May 2024. Studies were included if they used tissue flossing as a primary intervention among healthy participants and used one or more athletic performance measures as an outcome. Exclusion criteria included studies that did not investigate tissue flossing on athletic performance measures among healthy participants, studies that used tissue flossing for blood flow restriction training, case studies, narrative reviews, dissertations, conference proceedings, and papers written in a language other than English. Eighteen articles and 559 total participants were included in the final analysis. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Downs and Black Checklist and the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. The major findings suggest that a single tissue flossing treatment ranging from 2 to 10 min that includes active single joint or active closed chain exercises may enhance post-intervention muscle strength, jump performance, and balance up to 45 to 60 min post-intervention. Tissue flossing to a joint or soft tissue both produced mixed results among studies, a definitive answer on which technique is superior cannot be determined at this time. Further direct comparison studies are needed for these two techniques.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Centralising prostate cancer surgical and radiotherapy services, requires some patients to travel longer to access treatment, but its impact on actual treatment utilisation and outcomes is unknown. Methods Using national cancer registry records linked to administrative hospital data, we identified all patients with high risk and locally advanced prostate cancer diagnosed between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 in the English National Health Service (n = 15,971). Estimated travel times from the patient residential areas to the nearest hospital providing surgery or radiotherapy were estimated for journeys by car and by public transport. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model relationships between travel time and receipt of care with adjustment for patient characteristics. Results 10,693 (67%) men received radical surgery or radiotherapy (RT) within 12 months of diagnosis. Average travel time to the nearest hospital providing prostatectomy or RT was 23.2 min by private car and 58.2 min by public transport. We found no association between travel time, either by car or public transport and the likelihood of receiving curative treatment. Patients living in the most socially deprived areas, those aged over 70, those with two or more comorbidities, and those of black ethnic origin, were less likely to receive curative treatment (p& =& 0.001 for all associations). Conclusions The current configuration of national prostate cancer services is not associated with the likelihood of receiving curative treatment. Further increases in capacity will unlikely improve utilisation rates beyond addressing sociodemographic barriers.",

        "abstract": "Introduction We aimed to describe the relationship of educational attainment with the prevalence of six health outcomes (ever and current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in an older adult population, including whether education-health relationships differed by health outcome, by racial and ethnic (racial/ethnic) group, and by racial/ethnic group within the same level of education. Methods This cross-sectional study used 2015-2016 electronic health record data for 149,417 non-Hispanic White (White), 15,398 African-American or other Black (Black), 15,319 Hispanic or Latino (Latino), 10,133 Filipino, and 8810 Chinese Northern California health plan members aged 65-79 years whose preferred language was English. For each racial/ethnic group, sex-specific age-standardized prevalence of the six health outcomes was estimated for four levels of education (non-high school graduate, high school graduate, some college, college graduate). Age-adjusted prevalence ratios were used to compare the prevalence between adjacent levels of education and at lower versus college graduate levels within racial/ethnic groups, and the prevalence between White adults and adults in the other racial/ethnic groups, within each level of education and overall. Results The education-health relationship varied across racial/ethnic groups and health outcomes, with gradient relationships more consistently seen for White, Black, and Latino older adults than Filipino and Chinese older adults. Even when a gradient relationship was not observed, the prevalence at the college graduate level was usually significantly lower than the prevalence at the three lower levels of education. The prevalence of current smoking, diabetes, and hypertension was higher among Black than White adults at most levels of education. Controlling for education level minimally affected comparisons of overall prevalence of health outcomes between adults in the White and the other racial/ethnic groups, with the broadest impact seen for Latino-White comparisons. Conclusions The relationship of level of education and health outcomes differs across racial/ethnic groups and by health outcome. This should be taken into consideration when using education as a risk adjustment factor or predictor of health outcomes in multi-ethnic older adult populations.",

        "abstract": "Background: Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness responsible for seasonal epidemics and with potential to cause pandemics. The decline in influenza-related studies published since 2018 resulted in data gaps, particularly in emerging markets. Methods: This systematic review searched for studies in six databases and gray literature sources to define the clinical burden of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILIs) and their associated sequelae among humans across emerging markets. Eligible studies were published in English, Spanish, or Chinese between January 2018 and September 2023 and conducted in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Results: In total, 256 articles were included, mostly on lab-confirmed influenza infections (n = 218). Incidences of lab-confirmed influenza cases in Asia (range 540–1279 cases/100,000 persons) and Sub-Saharan Africa (range 34,100–47,800 cases/100,000 persons) were higher compared to Latin America (range 0.7–112 cases/100,000 persons) and the Middle East and North Africa (range 0.1–10 cases/100,000 persons). Proportions of lab-confirmed influenza cases and influenza-associated outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, ICU admission and death) varied widely across regions. Temporal variation in influenza trend was observed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: In conclusion, influenza causes significant disease burden in emerging markets. Robust large real-world studies using a similar methodology are needed to have more accurate estimates and compare studies within age groups and regions. Continuous monitoring of influenza epidemiology is important to inform vaccine programs in emerging markets with heavy influenza disease burden.",

        "abstract": "A consistent pattern emerges where African American students’ scores lag behind their counterparts on both national and state literacy assessments. One possible explanation is rooted in the fact that approximately 80% of African American students speak African American English, which differs from the General American English, the language expected to be used within educational settings. African American English encompasses distinct phonological and grammatical (morphosyntactic) features compared to General American English. This paper aims to delineate the differences between these two languages, review research on African American English, and explore the prevalence of bidialectal or multidialectal abilities among African American students. Additionally, it will address research indicating that many teachers and teacher educators lack awareness of African American English, leading to a deficit-oriented perspective that views African American English as a linguistic deficiency rather than a linguistic difference.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Research output on climate change and human health is growing rapidly. This can make it difficult to find and use relevant information to develop public health action. Methods We present a global scoping review of the rapidly growing quantitative research output on long-term climate change and human health. We searched Scopus, Embase, and PubMed for quantitative, English language literature published between January 2000 and June 2021 that referenced climate change and human health in titles, abstracts, or keywords. Results From 36,956 publications we identified 754 relevant studies. Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific were studied much more often than other WHO regions. Research on temperature and vectors accounted for 70% of all included publications. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases were the most studied specific health outcomes. We found very few studies on non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Retrospective publications (153) showed effects of climate change are already occurring worldwide. Most studies on tick-borne encephalitis, malaria, and lower respiratory infections associated with air pollution found impacts caused by climate change have increased. The strongest attribution of climate change was found for heat-related impacts. In prospective publications (626) diarrheal diseases, and impacts associated with heat and chemical air pollution were most consistently projected to increase. Future vector-borne disease impacts were projected to be highly location specific. Some studies demonstrated adaptation can effectively reduce impacts, while noting that capacity to adapt differs greatly between population groups. Conclusions Our findings underline climate change impacts are diverse and complex. Future research should prioritize the relatively understudied regions most vulnerable to climate change, such as Africa, and impacts beyond those related to temperature and vector-borne diseases.",

We observe significant differences between socio-demographical groups in the sub-dimensions of the Adult Learner Self-Directedness Scale. The study advances a theory on adult learner self-directedness in ODeLHE contexts. Educators should consider learners’ support practices, particularly in the cases of women, Black Africans, and younger cohorts. ODeLHE practices should also consider learners’ high school grades and proficiency in English, their library access, number of modules they are enrolled in, and who they support financially as factors influencing their level of self-directedness. Such considerations can be used to address the need for the translation of knowledge into policies and activities that improve educational opportunities for students.",

        "title": "Prevalence of metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease in people living with HIV and on antiretroviral treatment: A systematic review and meta‐analysis protocol",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the most common hepatic condition globally. The prevalence of MASLD continues to increase, paralleling the consistent rising rates of risk factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Literature suggests that human immunodeficiency virus‐infected (HIV‐infected) individuals may have an increased risk of developing MASLD due to a complex interplay of factors including antiretroviral therapy. Since the development and widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV‐induced liver disease has continued to be the predominant cause of liver‐related morbidity and mortality. This protocol serves to narrate the methods that will be employed in conducting the published literature search for the systematic review and meta‐analysis which will report on the global prevalence of MASLD on people living with HIV and on ARV treatment. Methods The search of literature will be done using search engines or electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, African Journal Online, and ResearchGate. Specific keywords will be used to search literature that has reported on the prevalence of MASLD among HIV patients receiving antiretroviral treatment, this will ensure the reproducibility of the study. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal observational studies, retrospective cohort studies, clinical trial studies, meta‐analyses, and systematic reviews that were published in the English language from 1990 to 2024 will be included. Animal studies will be excluded. Three independent reviewers will conduct the selection process and select studies that meet the eligibility criteria. A quality assessment tool, Downs and Blacks will be used to assess the risk of bias of the selected studies. A review manager will be used for meta‐analysis of collected data and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool will assess the strength of evidence. Ethics, dissemination, and registration The review will not require ethical clearance as it will only include data that is publicly available in published reports. The results of this review will be disseminated through publications. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024516814).",

        "abstract": "Mechanical keyboards are one of the most used keyboards in daily work, and as the core component of a mechanical keyboard, keyswitches’ characteristics have been widely researched during the last several decades. Meanwhile, keyboards’ backlight design has become an emerging market trend, even though its actual influence on user experience remains unknown. Our study investigated the influence of keyboard switch characteristics and backlight states on typing performance and subjective typing experience. Thirty-three participants were involved in an English-language typing task on keyboards with four typical switches (red, black, brown, and blue types). Software was used to automatically record typing speed and accuracy, and a 7-point Likert subjective scale was used to evaluate typing experience. Results showed that tactile characteristics performed better than linear switches in typing speed, accuracy, and subjective refresh feeling in pair comparison of blue and red switches, and turning on the backlight effect improved typing speed, refreshing feeling, and pleasure. Among six physical characteristics of switches measured in the experiment, pre travel, reset travel, make force, and bottom force contributed more to better typing performance and subjective experience. Our findings provide keyboard manufacturers and researchers with a reference to optimize users’ typing experience.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective The economic crisis in Lebanon, which began in 2019, has affected the healthcare system and patients' incomes. The aim of this study was to analyze the obstacles faced by people with epilepsy (PWE) during this crisis and to assess its impact on their quality of life. Methods The method used was a cross‐sectional study conducted among PWE aged 18–65 years, who were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire covering sociodemographic aspects, clinical aspects, the impact of the economic crisis, and the QOLIE‐31 (version 1.0), validated in English and Arabic, which assesses the quality of life of PWE. Results 71 patients were included in the study with an average age of 35.2 years [23.5; 62.5] (53.5% were males). Their average QOLIE‐31 score was 50.3 (+/− 17.9). A significant proportion (71%) of patients reported difficulties during the crisis, with 25% reporting having had seizure‐related injuries in the years 2022–2023 and 36.6% reporting an increase in seizure frequency compared to that prior to 2020. Moreover, many patients had to change (33.8%) or discontinue (18.3%) antiseizure medications, due to drug shortages, rising costs, and high gas prices. To mitigate these challenges, patients sought solutions such as obtaining medications from abroad (34%) or through donations (8%) or purchasing from the black market (8%). Low quality of life was associated with unemployment, low education level, the presence of focal seizures with impaired awareness or generalized seizures, polytherapy, seizure‐related injuries, and medication changes during the economic crisis. Significance These results highlight the considerable challenges faced by PWE in Lebanon during the economic crisis, emphasizing the negative effect of the crisis on their quality of life and seizure control. Plain Language Summary This study analyzed the obstacles faced by 71 people with epilepsy during Lebanon's economic crisis and showed that many patients had to change (33.8%) or discontinue (18.3%) antiseizure medications, due to drug shortages, rising costs, and high gas prices. To mitigate these challenges, patients sought solutions such as obtaining medications from abroad (34%) or through donations (8%) or purchasing from the black market (8%). This affected their quality of life. In fact, low quality of life was associated with unemployment, low education level, focal seizures with impaired awareness or generalized seizures, polytherapy, seizure‐related injuries, and medication changes.",

        "abstract": "The article discusses early modern English plays from the 1590s to the 1610s, set in or referring to the Mediterranean, which feature Black African characters in marginal roles. These characters are ‘spectral’ in that they have no speaking part but appear briefly as attendants, servants, musicians, or indeed slaves. The article argues that their spectrality evokes the presence of Black African slaves in the Mediterranean, which has often been ignored in Early Modern Studies. However, through these characters Black slavery is turned into a mere spectacle, performed for the gaze of the theatre audience in early modern London.",

        "abstract": "\n The field of Atlantic history initially focused exclusively on the Anglo-American North Atlantic, largely ignoring the South Atlantic and Africa. This approach, dominant after World War II, portrayed a “Western civilization” based on North Atlantic liberal values, akin to a postwar Mediterranean. Over time, historians of the Anglo-American Atlantic criticized this narrow focus, recognizing the broader interconnectedness of the Atlantic world. Recent decades have seen a shift, with more historians acknowledging the Atlantic as a complex, interconnected space involving four continents. Particularly notable is the rise of studies on the South Atlantic, especially regarding science and empire in the Iberian world. These studies highlight the significant role of Spain and Portugal, challenging the previously North Atlantic-centered narrative. This research has revealed that the Atlantic world was as much, if not more, shaped by Spanish and Portuguese influences as by English ones. The reviewed works exemplify this shift, focusing on the South Atlantic's imperial entanglements and the African diaspora in the Caribbean.",

        "title": "Characteristics of interventions that address racism in the United States and opportunities to integrate equity principles: a scoping review",
        "abstract": "Background As a driver of racial and health inequities, racism is deeply ingrained in the interconnected systems that affect health and well-being. Currently, no common frame is employed across researchers, interventionists, and funders to design, implement, and evaluate comprehensive interventions to address racism. Consequently, there is a need to examine the characteristics of interventions implemented in the United States that address racism across social and structural determinants of health and socio-ecological levels. Additionally, we utilized a Health Equity Action Research (HEART) framework to assess how interventions integrate equity principles. Methods This scoping review examined the characteristics of multi-level interventions that addressed racism and appraised the interventions using a Health Equity Action Research frame. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted across nine electronic databases between 24 October 2022 through 15 November 2022. Records were included if they were available in English, discussed or evaluated a multi-level intervention or program conducted in the United States, and discussed or evaluated the intervention or program regarding the health and well-being of racialized and ethnically minoritized groups. Results A total of 13,391 records were identified, of which 91 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Most records reported the racialized group impacted by an intervention, of which the majority were racialized as African American or Black (n = 42) and Hispanic or Latino/a/x (n = 18). Eighty-one (89%) of interventions reported health outcomes and concentrated on the individual level. Most funders reported across the records, and 86 (51%) were a federal agency or department. A further 43 (25%) were private foundations, 12 (7%) were nonprofit organizations, 10 (6%) were private universities, and 4 (2%) were public universities. Regarding alignment with the HEART framework, 14% of interventions reported a mixed-methods approach, 45% reported community engagement, and less than 1% reported researcher self-reflection. Conclusions Most interventions prioritized people who are racialized as Black and report health outcomes. Since intervention designs, objectives, and methodological approaches vary, no standard frame defines racism and health equity. Applying the HEART framework offers a standard approach for interventionists and researchers to examine power, integrate community voice, and self-reflect to advance health equity.

        "abstract": "Background Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has rapidly escalated over time, complicating treatment and increasing morbidity and mortality. Few studies have explored how the social determinants of health may be associated with patients’ risks for acquiring antibiotic-resistant (AR) uropathogens. Methods We identified urine cultures collected from outpatients presenting to Tufts Medical Center Primary Care Practices between 2015 and 2020. Specimens were included if patients’ age, sex, and residential address were recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) and if their urine culture yielded Enterococcus spp. or one or more gram-negative bacterial organism(s) or for which antibiotic susceptibility profiling and species identification was conducted. We abstracted patients’ sociodemographic characteristics from the EMR and used US Census Bureau data to identify characteristics about patients’ census tracts of residence. We evaluated associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics and patients’ risk of having a urine culture resistant to (1) three or more antibiotic classes (i.e., multidrug resistant [MDR]), (2) first-line treatments, (3) fluoroquinolones, (4) aminoglycosides, or (5) ceftriaxone using logistic regression models and a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple hypothesis testing. Results We included urine cultures from 1,306 unique outpatients, most of whom were female (89%). Patients largely self-identified as Non-Hispanic White (36%), Asian (15%), or Non-Hispanic Black (11%). Over 60% lived in an environmental justice-designated census tract. Most included isolates were Escherichia coli (76%) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). Using public insurance increased patients’ odds of having a uropathogen resistant to first-line antibiotics, but living in a limited-income neighborhood reduced patients’ odds of having a MDR uropathogen by 47%. We noted a strong but non-significant positive trend between speaking a language other than English and having an aminoglycoside-resistant uropathogen (p-value = 0.02). Most notably, after controlling for other factors, we observed no statistically significant associations between race or ethnicity and AR uropathogens. Conclusion The social determinants of health may play important and intersecting roles in determining a patient’s risk of having a resistant uropathogens that is more challenging or expensive to treat. It is crucial to acknowledge how race is likely to be a proxy for other factors affecting health, and to consider that some groups may be disproportionately impacted by antibiotic resistance.

        "abstract": "Background Persistent inequities in breast cancer outcomes exist. Understanding women’s experiences along the care pathway is the first step to finding solutions to tackle these inequities. Methods Secondary data analysis of the 2017/2018 English National Cancer Patient Experience Survey (n = 25,408) using logistic regression to explore inequities in care experience by sociodemographic factors (age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, sexual orientation) across 59 survey questions. We used the Candidacy Framework to interpret and organise our findings. Results Compared to older (65–74) and White British women, young (35-44, OR = 0.55 [0.44, 0.69]), Asian (OR = 0.52 [0.41, 0.67]), Black (OR = 0.67 [0.46, 0.97]) and White Other (OR = 0.63 [0.49, 0.81]) women were more likely to rate their overall care experience less positively, respectively. Similar findings were observed along all domains of the cancer pathway. Through a candidacy lens, we identified multilevel factors related to this variation including prolonged help-seeking behaviours (individual), poor patient-provider communication (interpersonal), and variation in access to healthcare professionals and resources (system level). Conclusion Multilevel factors influence inequities in the experience of care along the breast cancer pathway for young women and women from minoritised groups. Interventions are necessary to ensure cancer care systems are responsive to women’s health needs and provide equity of care to all patients.",

Official immigration records were linked with the Early Development Instrument assessments among children in kindergarten in the province of Manitoba, Canada (2005–2017). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of vulnerability in five developmental domains associated with maternal birthplace and child sex. Children of immigrant mothers from most birthplaces had higher adjusted odds of developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, except those of the rest of North America & Oceania. Children of Sub-Saharan African mothers were more vulnerable in four domains. Boys were consistently more vulnerable than girls across domains and maternal birthplaces. Children of immigrant mothers exhibited higher developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, potentially reflecting exposure to English and French as second languages.

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a transformer-based text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin also known as Naijá, a popular language in West Africa. Despite its wide use, Nigerian Pidgin remains under-resourced, particularly in areas related to text generation and natural language processing. These difficulties are primarily due to technological constraints rather than the language’s fundamental attributes. There is currently a demand for Nigerian Pidgin-specific solutions because it is used in everyday communication and has a unique linguistic blend. This paper aims to close this gap by exploring the application of state-of-the-art transformer technology to develop a text generation model for Nigerian Pidgin. This work uses the public Afriberta-corpus dataset to optimize the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) model across a sizeable dataset. The performance evaluators, BLEU and Perplexity metrics provide a detailed breakdown of the model’s text quality and predictive accuracy. Despite the difficulties caused by a limited amount of training data, preliminary evaluations show that the model can generate coherent Nigerian Pidgin text. The performance evaluation yielded perplexity scores of 43.56 for variable target reference length and 43.26 for fixed text length. BLEU scores of 0.15 for fixed max length and 0.56 for variable reference target length. This highlights the quality of generated text and the significant improvement when the generated text length is aligned with the reference target. Our work was benchmarked against African American Vernacular (AAVE) revealing that BLEU scores for AAVE are significantly lower than those for Standard American English, with BLEU given as 0.26. Our Nigerian Pidgin model, with a BLEU score of 0.56, shows a better performance. However, both results suggest that both dialects are challenging for language models. Leveraging the pre-trained transformer-based language model and evaluation metrics, we showcase the model’s capacity for coherent Nigerian Pidgin text generation. For future research, the research work can serve as a good foundation for advancement and progress in the Nigerian Pidgin language generation and other low-resource languages.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Estimates of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence and critically the amount of infection that is undiagnosed or unlinked to care are uncertain—even in countries like UK where vertical transmission and overall prevalence are very low. In the absence of country of birth data, we aim to estimate HBV prevalence through combining public health surveillance data on antenatally screened women by ethnic group and multipliers generated from non‐antenatally screened populations by ethnic group with English population denominators. Of 714,287 women aged 16–49 years with ethnic group data tested as part of antenatal care between 2015 and 2021, 4174 (0.6%) were HBsAg‐positive; 94% in people of ethnic groups other than White British. Of 1,447,467 people tested for HBsAg with ethnic group data from other testing sources (primary and secondary care excluding occupational health and renal services), 27,628 (1.9%) were HBsAg‐positive; 87% in people of ethnic groups other than White British. We estimate that the overall number and prevalence of people with chronic hepatitis B in England is 268,767 (95% CI: 227,896–314,044) and 0.58% (95% CI: 0.50–0.68). Approximately two‐thirds were male, one‐third female, and 68% were aged under 50. We estimate that over 83% of HBV infections are in people of ethnic groups other than White British, with 23% in people from Black ethnic groups, 21% from other White ethnic groups and 19% in Asian ethnic groups. These estimates are the first step towards establishing whether England can meet World Health Organisation targets to eliminate HBV as a public health problem—using methods that can also be used by other countries.",

        "abstract": "The increased quality and human-likeness of AI generated texts has resulted in a rising demand for neural text detectors, i.e. software that is able to detect whether a text was written by a human or generated by an AI. Such tools are often used in contexts where the use of AI is restricted or completely prohibited, e.g. in educational contexts. It is, therefore, important for the effectiveness of such tools that they are robust towards deliberate attempts to hide the fact that a text was generated by an AI. In this article, we investigate a broad range of adversarial attacks in English texts with six different neural text detectors, including commercial and research tools. While the results show that no detector is completely invulnerable to adversarial attacks, the latest generation of commercial detectors proved to be very robust and not significantly influenced by most of the evaluated attack strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background Patients with diabetes experience worse health outcomes and greater health care expenditure. Improving diabetes outcomes requires involved self-management. Peer coaching programs can help patients engage in self-management while addressing individual and structural barriers. These peer coaching programs can be scaled with digital platforms to efficiently connect patients with peer supporters who can help with diabetes self-management. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a technology-enabled peer coaching intervention to support diabetes self-management among patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Methods MetroPlusHealth, a predominant Medicaid health maintenance organization based in New York City, partnered with Pyx Health to enroll 300 Medicaid patients with uncontrolled diabetes into its 6-month peer coaching intervention. Pyx Health peer coaches conduct at least 2 evidence-based and goal-oriented coaching sessions per month with their assigned patients. These sessions are focused on addressing both behavioral and social determinants of health (SDoH) with the goal of helping patients increase their diabetes self-management literacy, implement self-management behaviors, and reduce barriers to ongoing self-care. Data analyzed in this study included patient demographic data, clinical data (patient’s hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and program implementation data including types of behavioral determinants of health and SDoH reported by patients and types of interventions used by peer coaches. Results A total of 330 patients enrolled in the peer mentoring program and 2118 patients were considered to be on a waitlist group and used as a comparator. Patients who enrolled in the peer coaching program were older; more likely to be English speakers, female, and African American; and less likely to be White or Asian American or Pacific Islander than those in the waitlist condition, and had similar HbA1c laboratory results at baseline (intervention group 10.59 vs waitlist condition 10.62) Patients in the enrolled group had on average a –1.37 point reduction in the HbA1c score (n=70; pre: 10.99, post 9.62; P<.001), whereas patients in the waitlist group had a –0.16 reduction in the HbA1c score (n=207; pre 9.75, post 9.49; P<.001). Among a subsample of participants enrolled in the program with at least 2 HbA1c scores, we found that endorsement of emotional health issues (β=1.344; P=.04) and medication issues (β=1.36; P=.04) were significantly related to increases in HbA1c. Conclusions This analysis of a technology-enabled 1-on-1 peer coaching program showed improved HbA1c levels for program participants relative to nonprogram participants. Results suggested participants with emotional stressors and medication management issues had worse outcomes and many preferred to connect through phone calls versus an app. These findings support the effectiveness of digital programs with multimodal approaches that include human support for improving diabetes self-management in a typically marginalized population with significant SDoH barriers.",

        "abstract": "Rare diseases affect 6%-8% of the population and present diagnostic challenges, particularly for historically marginalized ethnic and racial groups. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) aims to enhance diagnosis rates and research participation among such minoritized groups. A retrospective review was conducted from 2015 to 2023, analyzing 2235 UDN participants to evaluate its progress toward this objective. Data on demographics, disease phenotypes, diagnostic outcomes, and socioeconomic factors were collected and statistical analyses assessed differences among ethnic and racial groups. This demonstrated that Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic groups were underrepresented, while White non-Hispanic participants were overrepresented in the UDN compared to the US population. Individuals whose primary language was not English were also significantly underrepresented. Diagnosis rates varied, with the highest rates among Asian non-Hispanic (39.5%) and Hispanic (35.3%) groups and the lowest rate in the White non-Hispanic group (26.8%) (p < 0.001). Binomial logistic regression found, however, that only participant age and disease phenotype predicted the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis (p < 0.001). Persistent ethnic and racial disparities in UDN participation appear to be associated with major differences in application rates. Under-enrollment of historically marginalized ethnic and racial groups may be due to economic hardships and language barriers. No differences in the diagnostic yield among ethnic and racial groups were observed after controlling for other factors. This work highlights the value of comprehensive genetic evaluations for addressing healthcare disparities and suggests priorities for advancing inclusion in rare disease research.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Although studies have evaluated the hospital cost of care associated with treating patients with COVID-19, there are no studies that compare the hospital cost of care among racial and ethnic groups based on detailed cost accounting data. The aims of this study were to provide a detailed description of the hospital costs of COVID-19 based on individual resources during the hospital stay and standardized costs that do not rely on inflation adjustment and evaluate the extent to which hospital total cost of care for patients with COVID-19 differs by race and ethnicity. Methods This study used electronic medical record data from an urban academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois USA. Hospital cost of care was calculated using accounting data representing the cost of the resources used to the hospital (i.e., cost to the hospital, not payments). A multivariable generalized linear model with a log link function and inverse gaussian distribution family was used to calculate the average marginal effect (AME) for Black, White, and Hispanic patients. A second regression model further compared Hispanic patients by preferred language (English versus Spanish). Results In our sample of 1,853 patients, the average adjusted cost of care was significantly lower for Black compared to White patients (AME = -$5,606; 95% confidence interval (CI), -$10,711 to -$501), and Hispanic patients had higher cost of care compared to White patients (AME = $8,539, 95% CI, $3,963 to $13,115). In addition, Hispanic patients who preferred Spanish had significantly higher cost than Hispanic patients who preferred English (AME = $11,866; 95% CI $5,302 to $18,431). Conclusion Total cost of care takes into account both the intensity of the treatment as well as the duration of the hospital stay. Thus, policy makers and health systems can use cost of care as a proxy for severity, especially when looking at the disparities among different race and ethnicity groups.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Cervical cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in 36 low- and middle-income countries, with the majority located in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South America and Southeastern Asia. The highest regional incidence and mortality occur in SSA. Despite the high efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in preventing cervical cancer, its uptake remains unacceptably low in SSA. This scoping review aims to integrate evidence from SSA on social determinants of HPV vaccine uptake with complementary evidence on interventions to promote its uptake. Methods and analysis The proposed review will be conducted following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group. Additionally, a sequential explanatory design will guide the integration of determinant evidence with intervention evidence. This scoping review will be reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. Six databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, LIVIVO, Google Scholar, BASE (Grey Literature), preprint databases (eg, OSF and medRxiv) and African Journals Online will be searched, with results limited to English language publications and those published from 2006 to 2024. Two forms will be used for data extraction from determinant and intervention studies by two independent reviewers. A narrative summary of evidence from both determinant and intervention studies will be conducted. Furthermore, a multilevel analysis will be conducted to explore the intersections of determinants across socioecological levels of health behaviour. A further integrative cross-study analysis of results from determinant and intervention studies will be conducted, where the determinant evidence will be used to interrogate the intervention evidence. Data will be presented in tables and matrices. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval will be required for this study because it will be based on data collected from publicly available records. The review results will be disseminated widely through a peer-reviewed publication and other forums such as workshops, conferences and meetings with local health administrators, policymakers and other wider stakeholder engagements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Tobacco use spreads through social networks influencing social norms around tobacco use. However, the social norms scholarship is extremely diverse and occasionally conflicting, complicating efforts to understand how best to leverage social norms to reduce tobacco use. This study systematically reviewed and meta‐analyzed this vast terrain by focusing on social norms measurement and mechanism, and intervention effectiveness and modality aimed at changing social norms around tobacco use and actual tobacco use. Methods We searched Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo, Clinicaltrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations, the Cochrane Trial Registry, as well as the websites of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, the Open Science Framework, medrXiv and the Truth Initiative for experimental and quasi‐experimental evaluation studies of interventions designed to shift tobacco use. We included studies written in English from inception to 30 May 2024. We only included studies which noted social norms or social influence as part of the intervention design or set of measured variables. We excluded studies with only one time point, without an intervention being evaluated and those not published in English. Study screening followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and was conducted by at least two independent reviewers who resolved discrepancies through discussion and consensus. All included studies were analyzed in a narrative synthesis, and those providing sufficient statistics for tobacco and social norms outcomes were included in meta‐analyses, which were performed separately for tobacco outcomes and social norms outcomes. Study outcomes were transformed into a standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) and several meta‐regressions were fit to explore sources of heterogeneity using a robust variance estimation specification to handle effect size dependency. Results A total of 95 studies met inclusion criteria for the narrative synthesis, 200 effect sizes from 86 studies were included in the tobacco outcomes meta‐analysis, and 66 effect sizes from 29 studies were included in the social norms outcomes meta‐analysis. Nearly 90% of included studies were conducted in high‐income settings, with the remainder conducted in middle‐income settings. No studies were conducted in Latin America or on the African continent. Social norms change interventions had a statistically significant effect on reducing tobacco use and pro‐tobacco social normative perceptions [g = 0.233, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.166, 0.301, P < 0.001 and g = 0.292, 95% CI = 0.090, 0.494, P = 0.007, respectively]. Interventions were commonly conducted among schoolchildren in classrooms through multicomponent education sessions, often coupled with regular ‘booster' sessions over time. Among adult populations, motivational interviewing and other counselling approaches were used in some cases, and few interventions leveraged digital technologies to change social norms. Conclusions Social norms change interventions appear to be effective for reducing tobacco use and pro‐tobacco social normative perceptions. In particular, leveraging role models appears to be the most effective social norms change mechanisms for tobacco control.",

This paper draws on ethnographic data collected with working-class Black-British young people aged between 16 and 18. Through the careful management of identity and reputation, the young people in this paper negotiate affective struggles to attain and secure a high academic status within a deeply neoliberalised school context. The paper argues that the identity discourse of ‘Black excel-lence’ connects dimensions of class and race in the young people’s identity work. Black excellence is described as classed and racialised reflexivity which helped the young people pivot their identity as they sought to maximise their educational opportunities to transition into elite universities.",

        "abstract": "Background: The impact of clinical factors and social determinants of health on treatment patterns and health care costs among patients with HCC is unknown. Methods: Using 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service claims and a commercial multipayor claims database, we identified patients diagnosed with HCC from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. Surveillance receipt was defined 12 months prior to HCC diagnosis, whereas treatment and health care costs were assessed post-HCC diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between demographics, social determinants of health, and surveillance or HCC treatment. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to identify factors associated with total health care costs. Results: Of the 32,239 patients with HCC (mean age 68 y, 67% male, 73% White), 70% received surveillance and only half (51%) received any treatment. Curative treatment receipt was higher among those with prior surveillance (24% with CT/MRI and 18% with ultrasound vs. 9% with no surveillance). Curative treatment was independently associated with HCC surveillance and inversely associated with Black race, lower education level, and diagnosis in the year 2020 (COVID-19 year). Higher health care costs were independently associated with Black race, low English proficiency, living alone, and diagnosis in 2018–2020, and inversely associated with CT/MRI-based surveillance. Conclusions: Race and social determinants of health were independently associated with curative treatment receipt and health care costs. Increasing access to high-quality HCC surveillance may improve treatment receipt and reduce health disparities among patients with HCC.",

        "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent and costly condition globally, prompting the need to identify risk factors for effective management. Lower extremity misalignment plays a crucial role in the incidence of LBP. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the current evidence on a link between lower limb alignment and LBP, enhancing the understanding of this relationship. We searched four databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, up to September 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies related to LBP and lower limb alignment, with eligible study types including case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies, all written in English. Two authors independently screened and assessed the methodological quality of the retrieved papers using the Downs and Black quality assessment checklist. Data of interest including study design, age, sample size, cases, association, and P-value were extracted from the included studies. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with random effects model in RevMan version 5.4. Thirteen articles evaluating lower limb alignment in individuals with LBP were included (102,359 participants in total). The meta-analysis results demonstrated that increased pronation with strong evidence(p = 0.02), increased hip internal rotation with moderate evidence, and increased knee internal rotation with limited evidence are associated with an increased risk of LBP. Overall, while some studies supported a relationship between lower limb alignment and LBP, the heterogeneity of study designs and methodological limitations hindered drawing a definitive conclusion. Future research should emphasize prospective cohort studies, incorporating objective measures of lower extremity alignment and standardized outcome measures.",

        "abstract": "\n Several gaps remain in understanding individuals' water consumption reliance outcomes in disadvantaged communities. We utilize a cross-sectional sample of household-level survey data from predominantly low-income, minoritized households in Detroit, MI, to examine the relationship between tap and tap-alternative drinking water consumption and purchase behavior. We collected survey data from one English-speaking adult per household in May–October 2021 (n = 259). Consistent with past studies, tap water consumption is negatively correlated with single-use bottled water consumption and consuming drinking water from multiple sources. We also find tap distrust is correlated with tap-alternative water consumption, yet there is a surprising positive relationship between tap and overall bottled water consumption levels. Very low-income households were more likely to rely on bottled water and multiple other water sources simultaneously. Female respondents reported lower levels of most types of water consumption. Black respondents reported lower tap water and bottled water consumption but had higher levels of other tap-alternative source consumption. Our results call into question whether higher tap water consumption is synonymous with tap trust or with reduced bottled water consumption. Public health interventions must further address high levels of bottled water consumption among low-income individuals, and low tap water consumption among Black individuals.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Racial and ethnic healthcare disparities require innovative solutions. Patient portals enable online access to health records and clinician communication and are associated with improved health outcomes. Nevertheless, a digital divide in access to such portals persist, especially among people of minoritized race and non-English-speakers. This study assesses the impact of automatic enrollment (autoenrollment) on patient portal activation rates among adult patients at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), with a focus on disparities by race, ethnicity, and primary language. Materials and methods Starting March 2020, autoenrollment offers for patient portals were sent to UCSF adult patients aged 18 or older via text message. Analysis considered patient portal activation before and after the intervention, examining variations by race, ethnicity, and primary language. Descriptive statistics and an interrupted time series analysis were used to assess the intervention’s impact. Results Autoenrollment increased patient portal activation rates among all adult patients and patients of minoritized races saw greater increases in activation rates than White patients. While initially not statistically significant, by the end of the surveillance period, we observed statistically significant increases in activation rates in Latinx (3.5-fold, p = < 0.001), Black (3.2-fold, p = 0.003), and Asian (3.1-fold, p = 0.002) patient populations when compared with White patients. Increased activation rates over time in patients with a preferred language other than English (13-fold) were also statistically significant (p = < 0.001) when compared with the increase in English preferred language patients. Conclusion An organization-based workflow intervention that provided autoenrollment in patient portals via text message was associated with statistically significant mitigation of racial, ethnic, and language-based disparities in patient portal activation rates. Although promising, the autoenrollment intervention did not eliminate disparities in portal enrollment. More work must be done to close the digital divide in access to healthcare technology.

Through interviews, youth shared their plans to design and facilitate a book club differently than they had experienced in English classroom settings. Through the lenses of critical literacy and civic praxis, the youths' imaginings reveal a desire to talk about books that were relevant to their lives, involve discussions that were participant‐led and democratic, and lead to meaningful, tangible outcomes.

English is a tool, like basic arithmetic, or literacy, or computer skills. An ability they need to master in order to function effectively in today’s world. The L1 remains the learners primary language and the only they identify with what teachers aiming for is functional English-knowing bilingualism.\nSocio-political status:\nWith the European trade patterns, most of the known European-based Creole languages were existed in the coastal regions of the Americas, Western Africa, Goa and along with the west coast of India. Indian Ocean Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from Malagasy and possibly other Asian languages.\nLearning Language Through Culture:\nLearning other language is to understand the nature of the relationship between language and culture, learners need to engage with the ways in which context affects what is communicated and how. \nStandard English is the variety of English that is generally acknowledged as the model for the speech and writing of educated speakers in UK. It is also associated with Received Pronunciation or accent.\nIntuitive acquisition: We learn anther language the same way as we learnt our first language or mother tongue. Intuitive acquisition through lots of exposure to the language in authentic communicative situations.\nHabit-formation: Language is a set of habits: we mimic and memorize and drill the patterns of the language until we learn to produce the correct forms automatically. \nCognitive Process: Language involves the understanding of underlying rules: if we master these rules, we will be able to apply them in different contexts. That may be at school, home, with community or with others. \nSkill-learning: Language is a skill. We learn it in school just as we learn other skills: someone explains rules or words to us, we understand and practice them until we master them and use them fluently and skillfully.",

        "abstract": "Black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) is one of the most popular berries in Russia. Its biochemical properties make it part of a healthy diet. This review describes the role of black currant and its by-products in the food industry and defines its nutritional value, i.e., vitamin C, anthocyanins, and dietary fiber. It covered original Russian and English research articles and reviews published in 2015-2023 and indexed in the Russian Research Citation Index or Pubmed databases. The keywords were black currant in Russian and English. \nBlack currant berries are rich in dietary fiber, polyphenolic compounds, anthocyanins, vitamin C, and potassium. They cover human needs for these nutrients. Added to fermented dairy and grain foods at 5-20%, fresh or processed berries fortify them with dietary fiber, vitamin C, and anthocyanins while reducing energy value. As ingredients with color, taste, and aromatic compounds, black currant berries and their secondary products can be introduced into the formulations of various alcoholic beverages. Berry pomace is a technologically functional ingredient with a moisture-retaining ability that increases the antioxidant capacity of the final product. Juice and aqueous extracts of black currant pomace are used as picklers for fish and meat products to increase their microbiological safety and shelf-life. \nComplex processing of black currant berries is feasible as they are a valuable source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and anthocyanins. Products of their processing provide a concentrate of dietary fiber with natural antioxidants. However, functional foods as sources of biologically active substances need to follow special criteria for fortified products. Black currant and its by-products are a potential source of valuable biologically active substances. In small quantities, they can expand the range of food products but fail to satisfy human diet with biologically active substances or reduce the overall energy value.",

A PubMed search was conducted using the terms Hidradenitis suppurativa, comorbidities, skin of colour, African–American, Hispanic, and quality of life with relevant studies written in English and pertaining to the demographics and clinical trials were included. African American patients with HS tend to experience more severe disease manifestations, higher rates of comorbidities like inflammatory bowel disease and anaemia, increased healthcare utilisation, and a greater likelihood of surgical interventions. While the current literature provides extensive information about African Americans regarding comorbidities and disease prevalence, there is a lack of research on Hispanic and other ethnic groups. For future research, it is important to broaden our focus to include various ethnic groups. Addressing these disparities requires focused interventions, inclusive clinical research initiatives, and healthcare policies tailored to the specific needs of patients with skin of colour.",

        "abstract": "Background: Closed, unstable AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fractures are common injuries with similar distributions by age, sex, and race. The purpose of this study was to identify disparities in access to and utilization of surgical care for these injuries. Methods: Ambulatory patients ≥18 years of age with capitated Medicaid health insurance who presented from January 2016 to February 2020 with an isolated, closed AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fracture with radiographic evidence of instability were retrospectively identified at 1 Level-I safety-net trauma center. Associations between patient characteristics (age, sex, preferred language, race, ethnicity, housing status, employment, and substance use) and measures of access to and utilization of ankle fracture surgery (days from injury to evaluation, being offered surgery, undergoing surgery, and days from evaluation to surgery) were investigated on bivariable and multivariable analysis. Results: Of the 1,116 patients who were screened, 323 met the inclusion criteria. The included patients had a median age of 41 years; 207 patients (64%) were male and 255 (79%) were Hispanic. Patients presented at a mean of 4.6 ± 7.0 days from injury. Delayed presentation was associated with self-identification as Hispanic (rate ratio [RR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17, 3.12]) and with marijuana use (RR, 1.59; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.36), whereas significantly earlier presentation was associated with a non-English language preference (RR, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.89), alcohol abuse (RR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.99), and illicit drug use (RR, 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.67). Ankle fracture surgery was offered to 274 patients (85%). Experiencing homelessness was associated with a decreased likelihood of being offered surgery (odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.69). Of patients who were offered surgery, 216 (79%) underwent surgery. Black patients underwent surgery significantly less frequently than patients who identified as White (OR, 0.14; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.77). The median time from evaluation to surgery was 11 days (interquartile range, 7 to 14 days). Patients who used illicit drugs experienced a mean delay to surgery of 6.0 days relative to those who did not use illicit drugs (mean time to surgery, 16.8 ± 7.1 and 10.8 ± 5.1 days, respectively). Conclusions: We identified disparities in access to and utilization of surgical care for unstable AO/OTA 44B2 ankle fractures that negatively affected patients with Medicaid insurance who identified as Hispanic or Black, were experiencing homelessness, or used illicit drugs. These disparities may negatively affect outcomes for patients receiving care in similar environments, such as capitated health-care networks and public safety-net health systems.

        "abstract": "Climate change, a significant factor in global health disparities, has been linked to numerous health issues, including oral health disorders such as dental caries and enamel hypoplasia. Sustainable Developmental Goal 13 (SDG 13) accentuates immediate action to battle climatic changes and their complications. This scoping review aimed to explore the existing evidence in the literature linking SDG 13 with Early Childhood Caries (ECC). The review was carried out following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A rigorous search was done during the month of May 2024 using databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar with search MeSH terms related to climate change, Early Childhood Caries (ECC), and Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG). Publications or abstracts were included only in English from 2015 onwards, with no restrictions on the type of study. A summary of the eligible studies was compiled, highlighting the countries where the research was conducted, the type of study designs used, the region, study aims, and key findings. Additionally, the study results were analyzed to determine whether SDG 13 was addressed. The initial search provided 74 articles, of which 51 were duplicates, yielding 23 for screening. After applying the eligibility criteria, seven studies were finally reviewed. Two of the seven studies included were from the African continent (Kenya and Nigeria), and one was a multi-centric study involving various continents, Africa (Nigeria & Kenya), Asia (Saudi Arabia, Indonesia), and America (Canada, Brazil). Two other studies were conducted in the UK, China, and India, while one was from the USA and focused on how climate change impacts dental caries. Only three studies were found to be addressing SDG 13. The review established a plausible link between ECC and climate change factors, addressing the need to incorporate sustainable developmental strategies and eco-friendly preventive measures in pediatric dentistry.",

Context: The increase in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use has been notable for widening disparities between the least and most socially marginalized. Given access barriers, there is limited CGM patient experience information that is inclusive of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus from socially marginalized backgrounds. Objective: To understand the CGM usage experience across a U.S. Medicaid population with type 2 diabetes at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured phone interviews with 28 English or Spanish speaking participants prescribed CGM who were enrolled in a U.S. Medicaid program that subsidized CGM. Audio-recordings of interviews were transcribed and analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. Results: Participants had a median age 56 (interquartile range 48-60) with varying levels of formal schooling (55% with 9 years or less) and were from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds (57% Hispanic, 18% non-Hispanic Black, 21% non-Hispanic White). Interviews were conducted in English (68%) or Spanish (32%). We identified six major themes: initial expectations and overcoming initiation barriers (subthemes: initial expectations, overcoming initiation barriers), convenience and ease promote daily use (subthemes: benefits over fingersticks), increased knowledge leads to improved self-management (subthemes: increased understanding and knowledge, glucose level self-awareness, motivating healthy behaviors), collaboration with provider and clinical team, improved self-reported outcomes (subthemes: improved glucose and non-glucose targets, positive emotional effect, essential for management), and barriers and burdens are generally tolerated (subthemes: barriers to monitoring, burden of self-monitoring). Conclusions: CGM was experienced as easy to understand and use and viewed as a tool for diabetes self-efficacy. Expanded CGM access for socially marginalized patients with type 2 diabetes can enhance diabetes self-management to help mitigate diabetes outcome disparities. Presentation: 6/2/2024",

        "abstract": "Abstract Disclosure: S.K. Majumdar: None. J. Sinard: None. The Hobnail subtype of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is reported to be a rare form of PTC that manifests with higher rates of extrathyroidal extension, metastases, disease recurrence, and mortality, when compared to classic PTC. We set out to characterize the clinical manifestations and initial pathologic findings of patients with PTC and hobnail histology at our institution. A retrospective search of pathology records from 1/2014 through 1/2024 was conducted to identify rare thyroid cancer variants including those with hobnail histology. An electronic medical record review was then performed to collect clinical information. The study was approved by our institutional IRB. A total of 15 patients with PTC of the hobnail subtype (≥ 30% features) or with hobnail features (< 30%) were identified: 8 hobnail subtype, 5 having hobnail features, 1 had hobnail and oncocytic features, 1 had hobnail and tall cell features. Sixty percent were female, mean age 50.6 years (SD 16.4), 67% white, 27% Hispanic, 6% black. Mean BMI was 29.4 kg/m^2 (SD 5.4), 33% had a history of prior or current smoking. Cancers were found incidentally in 33% of cases (3 after physical exam noting goiter or nodule), 53% presented with a newly noticed neck lesion, one of these presented with hoarseness and cough from tracheal invasion which was found later at surgery. Mean tumor size 2.65 cm (SD 1.7), 13 patients had 1 or more lymph nodes removed with at least one node being positive in 77% of cases. Rates of lymphatic invasion were 73% (33% extensive), vascular invasion 13%, and 13% had gross extrathyroidal extension. After initial surgery 60% had stage 1 disease, 27% stage 2, and 13% stage 3. One patient was changed to stage 4 upon the later discovery of lung metastases and this patient had 30% tall cell features on pathology. Three patients had T3 or T4 tumors, all of whom were from minority and vulnerable populations (2 non-English speaking Hispanic, 1 Black with mental illness), had significantly higher BMI than others (36.2 ± 4 vs 27.2 ± 4.5, p = 0.01), and tended to be older (67 ± 9.5 vs 46.5 ± 16, p = 0.057 ns). Long term follow up was limited since hobnail histology was only found in reports beginning in 2017 and became more frequent in 2022 and 2023. Although limited by case number, our findings show that patients who presented with the most advanced disease were from vulnerable populations, were older, and had higher BMI’s than those with lower stage disease. Also, coexistence of other variants, like tall cell changes, may impact presentation. Therefore, while PTC with hobnail histology is typically associated with more advanced disease presentations, psychosocial and other factors appeared to explain higher stage disease at presentation in our series.

        "abstract": "Patient portals allowing access to electronic health care records and services can inform and empower but may widen existing sociodemographic inequities. We aimed to describe associations between activation of a paediatric patient portal and patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and markers of previous engagement with health care. A retrospective single site cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine patient portal adoption amongst families of children receiving care for chronic or complex disorders within the United Kingdom. Descriptive and multivariable regression analysis was undertaken to describe associations between predictors (Race/Ethnicity, age, socio-economic deprivation status based on family residence, and previous non-attendance to outpatient consultations) and outcome. A sample of 3687 children, representative of the diverse ‘real world’ patient population, was identified. Of these 37% (1364) were from a White British background, 71% (2631) had English as the primary family spoken language (PSL), 14% (532) lived in areas of high deprivation, and 17% (643) had high (>33%) rates of non-attendance. The families of 73% (2682) had activated the portal. In adjusted analyses, English as a PSL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.95) and multi-morbidity (aOR 1.26, 1.22–1.30) was positively associated with portal activation, whilst families from British Black African backgrounds (aOR 0.68, 0.50–0.93), and those with high rates of non-attendance (aOR 0.48, 0.40–0.58) were less likely to use the portal. Family race/ethnicity and previous low engagement with health care services are potentially key drivers of widening inequity in access to health care following the implementation of patient portals, a digital health innovation intended to inform and empower. Health care providers should be aware that innovative human-driven engagement approaches, targeted towards previously underserved communities, are needed to ensure equitable access to high quality patient-centred care.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The Understanding America Study (UAS) is a probability-based Internet panel housed at the Center for Economic and Social Research at the University of Southern California (USC). The UAS serves as a social and health sciences infrastructure for collecting data on the daily lives of US families and individuals. The collected information includes survey data, DNA from saliva samples, information from wearables, contextual and administrative linkages, ecological momentary assessments, self-recorded narratives and electronic records of financial transactions. The information collected focuses on a defining challenge of our time—identifying factors explaining racial, ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course, including racial discrimination, inequalities in access to education and healthcare, differences in physical, economic and social environments, and, more generally, the various opportunities and obstacles one encounters over the life course. The UAS infrastructure aims to optimise engagement with the wider research community both in data dissemination and in soliciting input on content and methods. To encourage input from the research community, we have reserved 100 000 min of survey time per year for outside researchers, who can propose to add survey questions four times a year. Participants The UAS currently comprises about 15 000 US residents (including a 3500-person California oversample) recruited by Address-Based Sampling and provided with Internet-enabled tablets if needed. Surveys are conducted in English and Spanish. Findings to date Since the founding of the UAS in 2014, we have conducted more than 600 surveys, including a sequence of surveys collecting biennial information on health and retirement (the complete Health and Retirement Study instrument), 11 cognitive assessments, personality, knowledge and use of information on Social Security programme rules, work disability and subjective well-being. Several hundreds of papers have been published based on the collected data in the UAS. Studies include documentations of the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how this varied across socioeconomic groups; comparisons of physical activity measured with accelerometers and by self-reports showing the dramatic biases in the latter; extensive studies have shown the power of using paradata in gauging cognitive change over time; several messaging experiments have shown the effectiveness of information provision on the quality of decision-making affecting well-being at older ages. Future plans The UAS national sample is planned to grow to 20 000 respondents by 2025, with subsamples of about 2500 African American, 2000 Asian and 3000 Hispanic participants and an oversample of rural areas. An increasing amount of non-interview data (contextual information, data from a suite of wearables and administrative linkages) is continually being added to the data files.",

Introduction: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glucose control in patients with diabetes, as demonstrated in clinical trials. There is limited information available on the real-world application of CGM adoption in a resource-limited setting or safety net outpatient hospital setting. This intervention's aim was to assess the impact of a multifaceted approach on improving CGM utilization and on glycemic control among patients with diabetes. Methods: Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, located in Brooklyn, NY is a resource-limited setting that in partnership with the Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA launched a CGM Clinical Care Optimization Program. This quality improvement (QI) initiative included establishing a diabetes technology team (DTT) which met weekly (n=24 sessions) to establish a highly specialized interprofessional group. The DTT activities included: 1) Establishing a CGM workflow; 2) Expanding Medical Assistant responsibilities related to diabetes technology and training; 3) Creating five bilingual (English-Spanish) patient handouts; 4) Building CGM vendor relationships; 5) Developing a CGM manual for data download, billing and coding, and education to increase CGM knowledge across the system. Data were collected prior to CGM initiation and at most recent visit. Results: The intervention occurred between February and November 2023. Prior to this intervention, 49 patients had a CGM prescription. After 9 months, CGM prescriptions were written for 333 patients (680% increase) with the following baseline characteristics (mean ± SD): age (61.2 ± 14.7 yrs.); 56% female; 44% male; 71% Latino; Race: 67% Other (63% Hispanic or Latino), 25% Black or African American, 4% White, Asian 2%, American Indian or Alaska Native 2%; 38% Spanish-speaking, 59% English-Speaking, 3% Other; 81% government insurance (63% Medicaid, 18% Medicare), 19% commercial insurance. The majority of patients had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (91%) and 9% had type 1 diabetes. Baseline HbA1C was 9.7 ± 1.5%. Of note, prior to CGM, 34% of patients had A1C>9%. The impact of CGM use was evaluated on 116 patients that met the following criteria: baseline A1C value within 60 days before or up-to 30 days after prescription, and a A1C >90 days after. After an average duration of 154 days of CGM use, HbA1c decreased significantly by -0.51% (p=0.001), demonstrating improved glycemic control post-CGM use. In those with A1c >9%, HbA1c decreased from 10.5% to 8.8% (p<0.01). Conclusion: Creating a CGM optimization program in a resource-limited setting is critical in improving patient self-awareness and provider insight in glycemic control in patients diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These data demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a CGM optimization program in a resource-limited setting, which is critically important in improving clinical care for people with diabetes.

        "abstract": "Introduction The Ages & Stages Questionnaire 3rd Edition (ASQ(R)-3) is a tool to measure developmental delay for children aged between 1 - 66 months originally developed in the United States. This measure has been collected in England since 2015 as a part of mandated 2-2[1/2]-year health visiting reviews and collated nationally in the Community Services Dataset (CSDS). CSDS is known to be incomplete and to-date there have not been any published analyses of ASQ(R)-3 held within CSDS. Objectives We aimed to a) identify a subset of complete child development data for children aged two in England using ASQ(R)-3 data in CSDS between 2018/19-2020/21; b) use this subset of data to analyse child development age 2-2[1/2] years in England. Methods We compared counts of ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS by local authority and financial quarter against national, publicly available health visiting metrics to identify local authorities with complete ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS. We described child development in this subset of the data using both a binary cut-off of whether a child reached expected level of development and the continuous ASQ(R)-3 score. Results Among the 226,505 children from 64 local authorities in our sample with complete ASQ(R)-3 records, 86.2% met expected level of development. Children from the most deprived neighbourhoods (82.6%), children recorded as Black (78.9%), and boys (81.7%) were less likely to meet expected level of development. Conclusions To fully understand child development in England, the completeness of ASQ(R)-3 data in the CSDS requires improvement. Second, to interpret the national CSDS data on child development, ASQ(R)-3 should be standardised and validated in an English context. Developmental support is needed for at least 13.8% of the children who did not meet the expected level of development, in particular children living in the most deprived neighbourhoods, those with Black ethnicity, and boys.

        "abstract": "Despite improvement in US healthcare, racial and ethnic minorities have experienced health disparities including sleep health disparities. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science) from the earliest available date to September 2023 using the keywords sleep inequity, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Meta analysis, case reports, and editorials were also excluded. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the National Library of Medicine and Keywords were used to search PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. We also searched the reference lists of the selected articles. Using the search strategy, we identified 52 articles. After excluding 11 duplicate studies, we screened 41 articles. The studies not relevant to our search were further excluded and we finally assessed 16 full-text articles. Twelve of the 16 studies were cross sectional and 4 were prospective studies. Compared to Whites, increased prevalence of shorter sleep duration was found among people of diverse racial background. Similarly, individuals with lower socioeconomic status have been shown to have a disproportionate increase in insufficient sleep (1.62 times). Additionally, compared to White women, Black women were more likely to report short sleep (37% vs. 27%) and were less likely to obtain the recommended amount of sleep (52% vs. 64%). This review demonstrates disparities in sleep based on race/ethnicity as well as the effect of gender and socioeconomic status on the quality of sleep.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Informal caregivers provide care to older adults but report lack of preparedness to enact the role. Intervention programs delivered by distance offer one alternative to support preparedness. Three review studies conducted to date have highlighted the benefits of distance interventions for enhancing preparedness among informal caregivers of older adults. However, these reviews have been limited in presenting and discussing how intervention components influenced outcomes. Additionally, they have not compared different distance delivery approaches for informal caregivers of older adults or assessed their varying impact on preparedness outcomes. These limitations make the effectiveness of diverse distance approaches unclear. Aim To evaluate the effects of distance interventions aimed at enhancing preparedness among informal caregivers of older adults. Methods This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and is guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. It has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023400668). Databases used in the search will include CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and ProQuest Theses and Dissertations Global. The search will not be restricted by publication year to include all relevant studies. Studies published in English and Portuguese will be included. Study quality will be assessed using Downs and Black’s checklist. If metanalysis is possible, it will be performed using the ReviewManager (RevMan) software. Conclusions The study will be the first of its type to systematically review and synthesize components and approaches of distance interventions aimed at supporting preparedness of informal caregivers of older adults.",

        "abstract": "Background Preterm birth is a major cause of infant mortality and morbidity and accounts for 7–8% of births in the UK. It is more common in women from socially deprived areas and from minority ethnic groups, but the reasons for this disparity are poorly understood. To inform interventions to improve child survival and their quality of life, this study examined the socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in preterm births (< 37 weeks of gestation at birth) within Health Trusts in England. Methods This study investigated socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in preterm birth rates across the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The NHS in England can be split into different units known as Trusts. We visualised between-Trust differences in preterm birth rates. Health Trusts were classified into five groups based on their standard deviation (SD) variation from the average national preterm birth rate. We used modified Poisson regression to compute risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with generalised estimating equations. Results The preterm birth rate ranged from 6.8/100 births for women living in the least deprived areas to 8.8/100 births for those living in the most deprived areas. Similarly, the preterm birth rate ranged from 7.8/100 births for white women, up to 8.6/100 births for black women. Some Health Trusts had lower than average preterm birth rates in white women whilst concurrently having higher than average preterm birth rates in black and Asian women. The risk of preterm birth was higher for women living in the most deprived areas and ethnicity (Asian). Conclusions There was evidence of variation in rates of preterm birth by ethnic group, with some Trusts reporting below average rates in white ethnic groups whilst concurrently reporting well above average rates for women from Asian or black ethnic groups. The risk of preterm birth varied substantially at the intersectionality of maternal ethnicity and the level of socioeconomic deprivation of their residency. In the absence of other explanations, these findings suggest that even within the same Health Trust, maternity care may vary depending on the women’s ethnicity and/or whether she lives in an area of high socioeconomic deprivation. Thus, social factors are likely key determinants of inequality in preterm birth rather than provision of maternity care alone.

        "abstract": "Objective Food insecurity is a prevalent social risk among emergency department (ED) patients. Patients who may benefit from food insecurity resources may be identified via ED-based screening; however, many patients experience difficulty accessing resources after discharge. Co-locating resources in or near the ED may improve utilization by patients, but this approach remains largely unstudied. This study characterized the acceptance and use of a food voucher redeemable at a hospital food market for patients who screened positive for food insecurity during their ED visit. Methods This prospective cohort study, conducted at a single county-funded ED, included consecutive adult patients who presented on weekdays between 8 am–8 pm from July–October 2022 and consented to research participation. We excluded patients who required resuscitation on arrival or could not provide written informed consent in English. Study participants completed a paper version of the two-question Hunger Vital Sign screening tool, administered by research staff. Participants who screened positive received a uniquely numbered $30 food voucher redeemable at the hospital’s co-located food market. Voucher redemption was quantified through regular evaluation of market receipt records at 30-day intervals. The primary outcome was the proportion of redeemed vouchers. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants screening positive for food insecurity, proportion of participants accepting vouchers, and associated descriptive statistics. Results Of the 396 eligible individuals approached, 377 (95.2%) consented and completed food insecurity screening. Most were middle-aged (median 53 years, interquartile range 30–58 years), 191 were female (50.4%), 242 were Black (63.9%), and 343 were non-Hispanic (91.0%). Of the participants, 228 (60.2%) screened positive for food insecurity and 224 received vouchers (98.2%), of which 86 were redeemed (38.4%) a median of nine days after the ED visit. Conclusion A high proportion of participants screened positive for food insecurity and accepted food vouchers; however, less than half of all vouchers were redeemed at the co-located food market. These results imply ED food voucher distribution for food insecurity is feasible, but co-location of resources alone may be insufficient in addressing the social risk and alludes to a limited understanding of facilitators and barriers to resource utilization following ED-based social needs screening.",

In this pre-registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42022372538), we evaluated and synthesized the available literature reporting the use of CAT as a diagnostic, treatment and mental health promotion intervention with adolescent refugees, aged 10-24 years.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nWe conducted a systematic search of the grey and black literature published in English and Arabic between 2012 to 2022 on 10 databases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSystematic database searches revealed 397 articles but only 5 met our inclusion criteria. These studies reported some positive outcomes but the evidence supporting the effectiveness of CAT as a diagnostic, treatment and mental health promotion intervention with adolescent refugees, aged 10-24 years is inconclusive.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings of this review point to the need for more methodologically robust studies that describe the intervention, implementation, and therapeutic approaches in greater detail to strengthen the evidence for the use of CAT with adolescent refugees.",

Design National cohort study. Setting All English National Health Service hospitals. Population A total of 6 192 140 women who gave birth in English NHS hospitals from April 2007 to March 2017. Methods Statistical analysis using birth and readmission data from routinely collected National Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. Main Outcome Measures Rate of emergency postnatal maternal hospital readmissions related to pregnancy or giving birth within 42 days postpartum, readmission diagnoses and association with maternal demographic factors, obstetric risk factors and postnatal LOS. Results A significant increase in the rate of emergency postnatal maternal readmissions from 15 128 (2.5%) in 2008 to 20 734 (3.4%) in 2016 (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.28–1.37) was found. Risk factors for readmission included minoritised ethnicity (particularly Black or Black British ethnicity: aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31–1.39); age < 20 years (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.12); 40+ years (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.10); primiparity (multiparity: aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91–0.93); nonspontaneous vaginal birth modes (emergency caesarean: aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.82–1.90); longer LOS (4+ vs. 0 days: aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.53–1.64); and obstetric risk factors including urinary retention (aOR 2.34, 95% CI 2.06–2.53) and postnatal wound breakdown (aOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.83–2.21). Conclusions The concerning rise in emergency maternal readmissions should be addressed from a health inequalities perspective focusing on women from minoritised ethnic groups; those < 20 and ≥ 40 years old; primiparous women; and those with specified obstetric risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are experts in communication and swallowing who work with individuals across the lifespan. Prior demographic surveys in English-speaking countries (e.g., Canada and the United States) suggest that SLPs gender, racial, linguistic, and cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds may not be aligned with those of their clientele. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic characteristics of current SLP students, to gauge whether the demographic composition of future clinicians is changing and is aligned with the population they are trained to serve. We designed an anonymous online survey, in the Canadian context, that enabled us to compare current SLP student demographics with statistics available about the target population at large. This survey was disseminated to all SLP students enrolled in an accredited institution in 2024. Participants answered questions about their age, sex and gender, linguistic, racial and cultural identities, and socioeconomic status. More than half (N=525, 53%) of currently enrolled SLP students completed the survey. Results indicate that SLP students are overwhelmingly cisgender females. SLP students spoke 48 unique languages, and while most were bi or multilingual, few felt competent enough in languages other than English and French to engage in clinical service delivery. There were 151 unique racial and ethnic identities reported, with the largest proportion of students identifying as 'North American.' Culturally most SLPs identified as 'Canadian.' Very few students identified as Black or Indigenous racially or culturally. Most respondents reported a higher-than-average total household income. Findings suggest that the demographic composition of current SLP students is more diverse than those currently practicing, however there is still over-, and underrepresentation of certain populations. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

        "title": "Past, Present, and Future of Judo in South Africa: A Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "\n \n There is a wide gap in judo participation between developing and developed countries. In South Africa (SA), there are only 2139 (0.00004% of the population) registered judokas compared to 122 000 (0,001% of the population) in Japan. This may be attributed to the fact that in developing countries such as SA, judo participation is dominated by a single race, generally the white race.\n \n \n \n This disjuncture is said to be informed by a combination of factors, including affordability, preferences, and the legacy of apartheid. Interestingly, despite being a popular sport amongst the white population in SA, judo is practiced by more black people than whites in some provinces, namely, the Eastern and Western Cape. The purpose of the research is to reflect on how judo has navigated, and migrated to its current form and what the future holds. A substantial literature search was done using PubMed, SCOPUS, SportDiscuss, Google Scholar, and Web of Science (2001 - June 2020). The synthesis of the literature suggests that the management of judo requires more than just financial resources; it also needs a well-defined organizational strategy.\n \n \n \n This study used 65 full-text English-language papers from 90 citations found through electronic searches. After removing duplicates and reviewing the full-text versions, 18 articles remained central to athlete success in the professionalization of federations. Federations that are run on a voluntary basis are seen as inefficient and unsustainable to successfully plan an athlete’s international success pathway.\n \n \n \n Furthermore, there is a consensus amongst researcher’s that professionalism and commercialization are central to improving athlete’s performance, participation, and efficacy in the athlete’s management system. Evidently, financial resources, a clear long-term plan and full-time coaching and administration staff play a critical role in the successful management of any Federation.\n",

        "abstract": "Background: Alopecic sarcoidosis is an uncommon cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis. Scarring and nonscarring alopecic sarcoidosis have been reported; however, information on the epidemiology, systemic disease associations, and treatment efficacy is limited. Objective: To address these gaps, we conducted a retrospective chart review and systematic literature review of alopecic sarcoidosis cases. Methods: Full-text English publications from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to August 2023 were analyzed. Treatment evidence quality was assessed using the modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine rating scale. Three patients with biopsy-proven alopecic sarcoidosis were included as a case series, all demonstrating systemic sarcoidosis and 2 requiring multiple therapies. Among 1778 search results, 60 articles representing 77 cases of alopecic and scalp sarcoidosis were included. Patients were categorized into 4 distinct alopecic subgroups. Black patients constituted the majority of all subgroups. Results: Extracutaneous sarcoidosis burden was high across all alopecic subgroups, with ocular disease appearing overrepresented. Topical and oral corticosteroids were the main treatments. Though scarring alopecia patients had poor outcomes despite receiving immunomodulators/cx, limited data suggest potential efficacy of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Limitations: This study has a small sample size. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of evidence-based strategies for improving alopecic sarcoidosis management. Prompt diagnosis and systemic evaluation, especially for scarring alopecia, are essential for timely intervention to optimize patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Although racially and ethnically minoritized populations are less likely to participate in cancer trials, it is unknown whether social determinants of health (SDOH) explain these inequities. Here we identify SDOH factors that contribute to racial and ethnic inequities in clinical trial participation among patients with 22 common cancers. Methods This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data (2011-2023) linked to neighborhood (US Census tract) data from multiple sources. Patients were followed from diagnosis to clinical study drug receipt (proxy for trial participation), death, or last recorded activity. Associations were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical factors (year of diagnosis, age, sex, performance status, disease stage, cancer type). To elucidate which area-level SDOH underlie racial and ethnic inequities, mediation analysis was performed using nonlinear multiple additive regression tree models. Results This study included 250 105 patients (64.7% non-Latinx White, 8.9% non-Latinx Black, 5.2% Latinx). Black and Latinx patients were more likely to live in economically or socially marginalized areas (eg, disproportionately minoritized [measure of segregation], limited English proficiency, low vehicle ownership) than White patients. Black (3.7%; hazard ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 0.60) and Latinx patients (4.4%; hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.69) were less likely to participate in trials than White patients (6.3%). Fewer patients in economically or socially marginalized neighborhoods participated in trials. Mediators explained 62.2% (95% CI = 49.5% to 74.8%) of participation inequities between Black and White patients; area-level SDOH—including segregation (29.9%, 95% CI = 21.2% to 38.6%) and vehicle ownership (11.6%, 95% CI = 7.0% to 16.1%)—were the most important mediators. Similarly, Latinx-White participation inequities were mediated (65.1%, 95% CI = 49.8% to 80.3%) by area-level SDOH, such as segregation (39.8%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 51.3%), limited English proficiency (11.6%, 95% CI = 2.8% to 20.4%), and vehicle ownership (9.6%, 95% CI = 5.8% to 13.5%). Conclusions To improve racial and ethnic diversity in cancer trials, efforts to address barriers related to adverse neighborhood SDOH factors are necessary.",

        "abstract": "We analyze Asian American comedian Ali Wong's linguistic and embodied performance in her 2016 stand‐up special, Baby Cobra, through a genre‐specific lens to investigate how stand‐up comedy's performance conventions shape her comedic persona. We argue that Wong uses communicative forms indexically associated with Blackness to perform racialized and gendered figures of personhood, including the white “Karen,” “sassy Black woman,” and “Asian grandmother.” This performance allows Wong to challenge hegemonic whiteness and dominant racializations of Asian women but relies on signs potentially interpreted as reproducing anti‐Black ideologies. We situate Wong as an individual performer, “Asian American” as an ethnoracial category vis‐à‐vis Blackness, and the linguistic practices of Asian and Black American communities within racial capitalist histories that have shaped contemporary raciolinguistic ideologies. Rather than approach language varieties and racialized groups as necessarily distinct, we treat them as relational—as necessarily intimately and historically connected.",

        "abstract": "Background Cannabis is the most common illicit substance used in pregnancy. As use continues to increase, understanding peoples’ behaviors surrounding cannabis use during pregnancy is needed to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The aim of this study was to better understand pregnant individuals' perceptions and knowledge of cannabis use and use patterns as well as the social and environmental factors that may influence their use. Methods We conducted interviews with 19 participants between December 2022 and March 2023. Individuals self-identified as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), were over 21 years of age, spoke English or Spanish, resided in California, and had used cannabis during pregnancy in the last 0–2 years. Using qualitative, constructivist grounded theory methods, we analyzed the contexts that contributed to participants’ lived experiences surrounding cannabis use behaviors during pregnancy. Results Participants reported making conscious decisions to responsibly manage their cannabis use during pregnancy to minimize potential harm to the fetus. Participants prioritized making what they perceived to be safer adjustments to their use of cannabis: (1) changing the amount of cannabis used, (2) changing the types of cannabis products used, and (3) changing sources of cannabis procurement. Discussion Our findings show that pregnant individuals are seeking information about safe cannabis use beyond medical supervision and are open to altering their cannabis consumption patterns. However, they are unable to find trustworthy and evidence-based harm reduction practices which can be implemented to mitigate harm to their unborn children. A harm reduction approach is needed in the field of maternal cannabis use to promote positive maternal and fetal health outcomes. Conclusions More data is needed on comprehensive harm reduction approaches to cannabis use during pregnancy. This requires implementation of education on these topics in healthcare settings presented by prenatal care clinicians.

        "abstract": "The effect of public pre-kindergarten (pre-K) on the short-term outcomes of children from disadvantaged backgrounds is well established; however, the mechanisms for this effect are not well understood. Of the many factors that influence how pre-K participants progress during and after kindergarten, one understudied factor is the effect of pre-K participation on kindergarten attendance. The effects of absenteeism are cumulative, and habits established early in the school years are likely to affect later school outcomes. Thus, if pre-K improves kindergarten attendance, participants may be poised for later school success. To begin to test this hypothesis, we conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine the kindergarten readiness of 19,490 children and attendance records of 39,113 children who either were enrolled in Michigan’s Great Start Readiness Program (GSRP) or were placed on waitlists because their GSRP sites were full. Using variants of multilevel modeling, we found, as expected, that GSRP children performed better than waitlisted children on the Kindergarten Readiness Assessment. Examination of kindergarten attendance records found that waitlisted children were more likely to be absent than their counterparts who participated in GSRP, with particularly strong effects for children who were Black, economically disadvantaged, or English Language Learners.",

Participants completed the PSS-4 at three timepoints at six-month intervals in a one-year period. There were 290 participants who (80.3%) identified as female, 51 (14.1%) identified as male, eight (2.2%) identified as gender variant/non-conforming, seven (1.9%) wrote in their own gender identity (e.g., genderqueer, gender expansive), three (0.8%) identified as Transgender male, and two (0.6%) did not respond to the item. The racial and ethnic backgrounds were as follows: White (87.3%), Multiracial (5.5%), Latino or Hispanic or Spanish (2.8%), Black or African American (1.4%), Asian (0.8%), Middle Eastern (0.8%), and five did not respond to the item (1.4%). We found unidimensionality evidence of the PSS-4 across all three timepoints and response categories were monotonically ordered. We also found that across all timepoints, the average person location was lower than the average item location, suggesting that the PSS-4 may not be well-targeted for this sample of mental health counsellors.

        "abstract": "\n Fish spawning aggregations are vulnerable to overexploitation, which can have severe ecological, social, and economic consequences. Knowledge on the spatial ecology of aggregating species is often lacking, but is crucial for their effective conservation. This study explores the spawning site residency, interannual fidelity, and migration of black seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus using acoustic (n = 55) and conventional (n = 2397) tagging within and outside Marine Conservation Zones in the southern UK. Detections and recaptures of tagged fish indicated that black seabream display significant interannual fidelity to nesting areas, but that residency of individuals at nesting areas was short relative to current temporal management of these areas. Locations of detection and recapture during autumn/winter indicated migration by black seabream into deeper waters of the English Channel and coastal waters of France and the Channel Islands. The results indicate spatial structuring of black seabream populations maintained by homing of adults to previously occupied sites. However, short residency periods within protected reproductive sites, and evidence of transboundary migrations emphasize the importance of effective fisheries management, i.e. collaborative between European nations. These findings highlight the importance of international-scale telemetry studies and networks for informing ecosystem-based fisheries management of sensitive migratory species.",

        "abstract": "Depression among Black women is a significant public health concern. However, our understanding of their unique experiences and the barriers and facilitators to utilising healthcare services remains limited. To address these issues, we conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis in collaboration with experts by lived experiences. We searched seven databases (ASSIA, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, CINAHL, AMED and EMBASE) from inception to 9th September 2021 and updated to 29th March 2024 with an English language restriction. Study quality and confidence in findings were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) approach. Of 15025 papers screened, 45 were eligible for inclusion. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Women reported depression stemming from racial and gender-related stressors, social isolation, and a loss of faith; moreover, the Strong Black Woman schema masked depression symptoms. Mistrust of healthcare providers, stigma, religious coping, and pressure to conform to the Strong Black Woman schema hindered healthcare service utilisation. The rapport between women and their healthcare providers, endorsement from faith leaders, and points of crisis enabled service utilisation. Lived experience experts provided reflections and recommendations for practice.",

        "abstract": "Importance\nIncreasing numbers of unaffected individuals could benefit from genetic evaluation for inherited cancer susceptibility. Automated conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are being developed for cancer genetics contexts; however, randomized comparisons with standard of care (SOC) are needed.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine whether chatbot and SOC approaches are equivalent in completion of pretest cancer genetic services and genetic testing.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis equivalence trial (Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services [BRIDGE] randomized clinical trial) was conducted between August 15, 2020, and August 31, 2023, at 2 US health care systems (University of Utah Health and NYU Langone Health). Participants were aged 25 to 60 years, had had a primary care visit in the previous 3 years, were eligible for cancer genetic evaluation, were English or Spanish speaking, had no prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, had no prior cancer genetic counseling or testing, and had an electronic patient portal account.\n\n\nIntervention\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 at the patient level to the study groups at each site. In the chatbot intervention group, patients were invited in a patient portal outreach message to complete a pretest genetics education chat. In the enhanced SOC control group, patients were invited to complete an SOC pretest appointment with a certified genetic counselor.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPrimary outcomes were completion of pretest cancer genetic services (ie, pretest genetics education chat or pretest genetic counseling appointment) and completion of genetic testing. Equivalence hypothesis testing was used to compare the study groups.\n\n\nResults\nThis study included 3073 patients (1554 in the chatbot group and 1519 in the enhanced SOC control group). Their mean (SD) age at outreach was 43.8 (9.9) years, and most (2233 of 3063 [72.9%]) were women. A total of 204 patients (7.3%) were Black, 317 (11.4%) were Latinx, and 2094 (75.0%) were White. The estimated percentage point difference for completion of pretest cancer genetic services between groups was 2.0 (95% CI, -1.1 to 5.0). The estimated percentage point difference for completion of genetic testing was -1.3 (95% CI, -3.7 to 1.1). Analyses suggested equivalence in the primary outcomes.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThe findings of the BRIDGE equivalence trial support the use of chatbot approaches to offer cancer genetic services. Chatbot tools can be a key component of sustainable and scalable population health management strategies to enhance access to cancer genetic services.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03985852.",

        "title": "Strategies for Identifying and Recruiting Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer for Research Outside of Clinical Settings: Observational Study",
        "abstract": "Background Research is needed to understand and address barriers to risk management for women at high (≥20% lifetime) risk for breast cancer, but recruiting this population for research studies is challenging. Objective This paper compares a variety of recruitment strategies used for a cross-sectional, observational study of high-risk women. Methods Eligible participants were assigned female at birth, aged 25-85 years, English-speaking, living in the United States, and at high risk for breast cancer as defined by the American College of Radiology. Individuals were excluded if they had a personal history of breast cancer, prior bilateral mastectomy, medical contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging, or were not up-to-date on screening mammography per American College of Radiology guidelines. Participants were recruited from August 2020 to January 2021 using the following mechanisms: targeted Facebook advertisements, Twitter posts, ResearchMatch (a web-based research recruitment database), community partner promotions, paper flyers, and community outreach events. Interested individuals were directed to a secure website with eligibility screening questions. Participants self-reported method of recruitment during the eligibility screening. For each recruitment strategy, we calculated the rate of eligible respondents and completed surveys, costs per eligible participant, and participant demographics. Results We received 1566 unique responses to the eligibility screener. Participants most often reported recruitment via Facebook advertisements (724/1566, 46%) and ResearchMatch (646/1566, 41%). Community partner promotions resulted in the highest proportion of eligible respondents (24/46, 52%), while ResearchMatch had the lowest proportion of eligible respondents (73/646, 11%). Word of mouth was the most cost-effective recruitment strategy (US $4.66 per completed survey response) and paper flyers were the least cost-effective (US $1448.13 per completed survey response). The demographic characteristics of eligible respondents varied by recruitment strategy: Twitter posts and community outreach events resulted in the highest proportion of Hispanic or Latina women (1/4, 25% and 2/6, 33%, respectively), and community partner promotions resulted in the highest proportion of non-Hispanic Black women (4/24, 17%). Conclusions Although recruitment strategies varied in their yield of study participants, results overall support the feasibility of identifying and recruiting women at high risk for breast cancer outside of clinical settings. Researchers must balance the associated costs and participant yield of various recruitment strategies in planning future studies focused on high-risk women.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Diabetes disparities exist based on socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity. The aim of this study is to compare two cohorts with diabetes from California and Florida to better elucidate how health outcomes are stratified within underserved communities according to state location, race, and ethnicity. Research design and methods Two cohorts were recruited for comparison from 20 Federally Qualified Health Centers as part of a larger ECHO Diabetes program. Participant-level data included surveys and HbA1c collection. Center-level data included Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set metrics. Demographic characteristics were summarized overall and stratified by state (frequencies, percentages, means (95% CIs)). Generalized linear mixed models were used to compute and compare model-estimated rates and means. Results Participant-level cohort: 582 adults with diabetes were recruited (33.0% type 1 diabetes (T1D), 67.0% type 2 diabetes (T2D)). Mean age was 51.1 years (95% CI 49.5, 52.6); 80.7% publicly insured or uninsured; 43.7% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 31.6% Hispanic, 7.9% non-Hispanic black (NHB) and 16.8% other. Center-level cohort: 32 796 adults with diabetes were represented (3.4% with T1D, 96.6% with T2D; 72.7% publicly insured or uninsured). Florida had higher rates of uninsured (p<0.0001), lower continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use (18.3% Florida; 35.9% California, p<0.0001), and pump use (10.2% Florida; 26.5% California, p<0.0001), and higher proportions of people with T1D/T2D>9% HbA1c (p<0.001). Risk was stratified within states with NHB participants having higher HbA1c (mean 9.5 (95% CI 8.9, 10.0) compared with NHW with a mean of 8.4 (95% CI 7.8, 9.0), p=0.0058), lower pump use (p=0.0426) and CGM use (p=0.0192). People who prefer to speak English were more likely to use a CGM (p=0.0386). Conclusions Characteristics of medically underserved communities with diabetes vary by state and by race and ethnicity. Florida’s lack of Medicaid expansion could be a factor in worsened risks for vulnerable communities with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE We undertook a trial to test the efficacy of a technology-assisted health coaching intervention for weight management, called Goals for Eating and Moving (GEM), within primary care. METHODS This cluster-randomized controlled trial enrolled 19 primary care teams with 63 clinicians; 9 teams were randomized to GEM and 10 to enhanced usual care (EUC). The GEM intervention included 1 in-person and up to 12 telephone-delivered coaching sessions. Coaches supported goal setting and engagement with weight management programs, facilitated by a software tool. Patients in the EUC arm received educational handouts. We enrolled patients who spoke English or Spanish, were aged 18 to 69 years, and either were overweight (body mass index 25-29 kg/m2) with a weight-related comorbidity or had obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). The primary outcome (weight change at 12 months) and exploratory outcomes (eg, program attendance, diet, physical activity) were analyzed according to intention to treat. RESULTS We enrolled 489 patients (220 in the GEM arm, 269 in the EUC arm). Their mean (SD) age was 49.8 (12.1) years; 44% were male, 41% Hispanic, and 44% non-Hispanic Black. At 12 months, the mean adjusted weight change (standard error) was −1.4 (0.8) kg in the GEM arm vs −0.8 (1.6) kg in the EUC arm, a nonsignificant difference (P = .48). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed that the GEM arm had a greater change than the EUC arm in mean number of weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity other than walking, a finding that may warrant further exploration. CONCLUSIONS The GEM intervention did not achieve clinically important weight loss in primary care. Although this was a negative study possibly affected by health system resource limitations and disruptions, its findings can guide the development of similar interventions. Future studies could explore the efficacy of higher-intensity interventions and interventions that include medication and bariatric surgery options, in addition to lifestyle modification.",

New approaches to the study of the phenomenon are introduced, while a limited study puts some of the author’s suggestions to the test. The study addresses the modus operandi of political and labour surveillance focusing on late medieval English towns. Surveillance was intensified after the Black Death. Institutional and noninstitutional surveillance were part of everyday life, but they were also used by the ruling elites to consolidate their power. Surveillance was endured by the lower social ranks. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that sometimes popular classes resisted surveillance or even used it to their own advantage.",

        "title": "Narratives of pregnancy across 19 Countries: Analysis of a 1.5-billion-word news media database",
        "abstract": "Pregnancy is a universal experience shaped by sociocultural contexts. News media presents a unique opportunity to analyze public narratives of pregnancy and how it differs across cultures. Our study aims to (1) identify the most prevalent overall themes in news media narratives of pregnancy across 19 English-speaking countries, and (2) compare pregnancy narratives across geographic regions. We used the largest English news media corpus that included over 30 million news articles from more than 7000 news websites across 19 countries, and extracted a one-year data subset (2019; 1.5 billion words). Of the primary search terms ‘pregnant’ and ‘pregnancy’, we collated 240,464 descriptors that met criteria of lexical proximity and semantic bonding. Thereafter, we used topic modelling to identify the five most prevalent pregnancy-related themes: (1) complications and risk, (2) crime, (3) celebration, (4) celebrity births, and (5) contraception. Although there were regional differences, themes of complications and risk were most common, comprising 39.6% of all pregnancy narratives in our big-data corpus. The second-most dominant theme was crime (20.8%). Narratives of contraception were more prevalent in Europe, North America, and Oceania (27.2–31.3%) compared to Africa and Asia (11.9–19.6%). Though the vast majority of pregnancies are healthy, themes of complications and risk dominated the news media discourse; unchecked, this may be an avenue for misinformation, stress, and anxiety. In addition, lower prevalence of contraception narratives in Africa and Asia may reflect a gap that requires the attention of policymakers in building culturally-adapted programs to promote family planning and encourage open discussions about sexual health. Results contribute to the academic repository of societal representations of pregnancy through a big-data lens, providing contextual information for future development, implementation and evaluation of localized pregnancy-related campaigns.",

        "abstract": "\n \n The International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine—ISPRM—is the pre-eminent scientific and educational society for medical specialists in rehabilitation. Its mission is to optimize functioning and health-related quality of life and minimize disability in persons with medical problems. The World Congress remains the society’s face-to-face meeting to update topics related to disability and rehabilitation. This manuscript describes the academic proposals and abstracts submitted and accepted after peer review, sorting them out according to the Standardized Abstract Topic List of the ISPRM World Congress bidding guidelines. It also aims to give recommendations for future congresses.\n \n \n \n This study is a cross-sectional descriptive study of academic proposals and abstracts submitted to the ISPRM2023 Congress in Cartagena. To structure the academic program, the Congress Scientific Committee (CSC) opened 2 calls for wide-open international participation: one for academic proposals (Scientific sessions and workshops led by top experts) and another for abstract submissions inviting rehabilitation professionals in general, according to the ISPRM Congress classification of topics. Six members of the CSC assessed the academic proposals to ensure the representation of diverse topics and geographic areas. The abstracts were peer-reviewed following predefined quality criteria and assigned to 3 international juries according to their expertise.\n \n \n \n Participants submitted 142 proposals in English and 42 in Spanish from 6 continents: North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The Clinical Sciences category (58.7%) out of 138 accepted proposals was the most common. Of 703 submitted abstracts, 692 got accepted to present their work, but only 418 were presented on-site: 127 (30.4%) oral and 291 poster presentations. The distribution of the submitted abstracts showed substantial interest in clinical science and therapeutics (73.9%), followed by engineering and technology (9.1%), biomedical sciences (4.5%), and health policy and systems (4.5%).\n \n \n \n We made 8 recommendations for future congresses. It will be essential to review the topics involving emerging ones in physical and rehabilitation medicine that are gaining relevance, such as infectious diseases (COVID-19), cardiopulmonary disorders, metabolic diseases (obesity, osteoporosis), diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound, and electrodiagnosis.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Toxoplasma gondii, a ubiquitous zoonotic parasite infecting warm-blooded animals, poses a significant health threat to workers with occupational animal exposure (WOEA) due to their frequent contact with potential reservoirs. Existing data on T. gondii seroprevalence in the WOEA exhibits substantial global variation. This systematic review and meta-analysis, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, aimed to quantify the global seroprevalence of T. gondii infection among WOEA over the past five decades (1972–2023). We identified 66 eligible studies through a comprehensive search strategy encompassing English publications, with a total sample size of 15,279. A random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey transformation in STATA v16.0 accounted for the high heterogeneity observed. We estimated the pooled global seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in WOEA at 41% (95% CI: 36–47%). Subgroup analyses revealed significant variations by gender: males (63%) vs. females (37%) (p < 0.05), occupation: non-livestock workers (54%), livestock workers (47%), slaughterhouse workers (44%), and veterinary personnel (27%) (p < 0.05). Geographic trends showed the highest prevalence in Africa (51%), followed by South America (49%), Europe (47%), Australia (43%), Asia (36%), and North America (23%; p < 0.05). Lower prevalence was observed in high-income (39%) and upper-middle-income (38%) countries compared to lower-middle-income (44%) and low-income (48%) countries (p < 0.05). This analysis underscores the high global seroprevalence of T. gondii in the WOEA, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in this high-risk population.",

        "title": "What – and how – should we teach when we teach English in (South) Africa?",
        "abstract": "This study proposes changes to the teaching of English (language and literature) in South African institutions of learning in ways that prioritise functionality and communicative competence rather than the current dominant and problematic approach that seeks adherence to received standards. The author draws on his personal experience as a lecturer in a comprehensive South African university in a semi-rural setting as well as on postcolonial and decolonial perspectives on the many problems associated with epistemological access and literacy rates across South African schools and universities. Invoking a decades-old proposition by American writer, James Baldwin (1965) and Nigerian novelist, Chinua Achebe (1965) that formerly colonised people should use English for their practical purposes rather than try to imitate so-called native speakers, the author argues for a ‘world englishes’ and descriptive grammar approach to the teaching and learning of English in South Africa. Based on these ideas, a strategy with an action research component for the transformation of language, literature and literary pedagogy is proposed. Finally, the study demonstrated how such a strategy could also contribute to the objective of decolonising English studies in non-nativist ways. Though the discussion is grounded more particularly in South Africa, the issues and proposals are practicable to a significantly wider African context.\n\nKeywords: South Africa, English Studies, World Englishes, Prescriptive Grammar, Decolonisation",

        "abstract": "This study examines the Mediterranean Gull (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus), utilizing GPS/GSM transmitters year-round for the first time on this species. The research covers habitat use, migration patterns, and breeding behaviors, tracking 19 birds captured at breeding colonies in Poland. To capture the birds and fit transmitters, we selected representative locations: islands in dam reservoirs, gravel pits, rivers, and lakes. Mediterranean Gulls nested mainly in colonies of Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). By tracking birds with transmitters, we identified nine additional breeding sites within Poland, the Czechia, and Germany. We determined the mean length of phenological periods: breeding (76, April 10–June 26), autumn migration (11, June 26–July 7), winter (261, July 5–March 23), and spring migration (18, March 23–April 10). According to residence sites analysis, cropland was the most frequently used habitat during breeding (52.9%), while the open sea was predominant in winter (25.8%). We identified key wintering areas: the English Channel, the Utrecht–Antwerpen area, the North Sea coast, and the Irish Sea coast. One individual wintered along the coast of Portugal and near Malaga in Spain. An interesting discovery was the longer spring migration than autumn what involved visits to multiple potential breeding sites, leading to the mapping of a network of potential breeding areas. This underscores the need for proactive habitat protection and comprehensive conservation strategies. Given the Mediterranean Gull’s migratory behavior and lifecycle, the study advocates for it as a model for conserving migratory waterbirds.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology.",

        "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest public research funder in the world. In an effort to make publicly funded data more accessible, the NIH established a new Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy effective January 2023. Though the new policy was available for public comment, the patient perspective and the potential unintended consequences of the policy on patients’ willingness to participate in research have been underexplored. This study aimed to determine: (1) participant preferences about the types of data they are willing to share with external entities, and (2) participant perspectives regarding the updated 2023 NIH DMS policy. A cross-sectional, nationally representative online survey was conducted among 610 English-speaking US adults in March 2023 using Prolific. Overall, 50% of the sample identified as women, 13% as Black or African American, and 7% as Hispanic or Latino, with a mean age of 46 years. The majority of respondents (65%) agreed with the NIH policy, but racial differences were noted with a higher percentage (28%) of Black participants indicating a decrease in willingness to participate in research studies with the updated policy in place. Participants were more willing to share research data with healthcare providers, yet their preferences for data sharing varied depending on the type of data to be shared and the recipients. Participants were less willing to share sexual health and fertility data with health technology companies (41%) and public repositories (37%) compared to their healthcare providers (75%). The findings highlight the importance of adopting a transparent approach to data sharing that balances protecting patient autonomy with more open data sharing.",

        "abstract": "Vietnamese women have a higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and are less likely to have ever been screened for cervical cancer than their White counterparts in the US. This review synthesizes findings from published interventions to promote cervical cancer screening in this vulnerable population. Articles were identified through a systematic search of PsycInfo, Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials in October 2022. Articles were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English, included one or more interventions promoting cervical cancer screening, assessed at least one outcome relevant to screening, and included a sample of ≥ 70% Vietnamese participants. Quality assessment scores were computed using the Downs and Black Checklist. Fifteen articles met review inclusion criteria. Studies were, on average, of good quality. Most studies were conducted in the US (n = 12), used a quasi-experimental design (n = 9), and employed multiple intervention strategies (n = 12). Intervention strategies included educational sessions, lay health worker (LHW) outreach, small media, mass media, patient navigation, and community or healthcare-based strategies. The most common study outcomes were screening intention and receipt. All but two studies reported improved cervical cancer screening outcomes following intervention. Findings support the effectiveness of multicomponent culturally tailored interventions to improve cervical cancer screening outcomes in immigrant Vietnamese women. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions will be as successful in non-US countries and to address broader community- and healthcare-based factors in screening.",

        "abstract": "Background CA-125 testing is a recommended first line investigation for women presenting with possible symptoms of ovarian cancer in English primary care, to help determine whether further investigation for ovarian cancer is needed. It is currently not known how well the CA-125 test performs in ovarian cancer detection for patients from different ethnic groups. Methods A retrospective cohort study utilising English primary care data linked to the national cancer registry was undertaken. Women aged ≥ 40 years with a CA-125 test between 2010 and 2017 were included. Logistic regression predicted one-year ovarian cancer incidence by ethnicity, adjusting for age, deprivation status, and comorbidity score. The estimated incidence of ovarian cancer by CA-125 level was modelled for each ethnic group using restricted cubic splines. Results The diagnostic performance of CA-125 differed for women from different ethnicities. In an unadjusted analysis, predicted CA-125 levels for Asian and Black women were higher than White women at corresponding probabilities of ovarian cancer. The higher PPVs for White women compared to Asian or Black women were eliminated by inclusion of covariates. Conclusion The introduction of ethnicity-specific thresholds may increase the specificity and PPVs of CA-125 in ovarian cancer detection at the expense of sensitivity, particularly for Asian and Black women. As such, we cannot recommend the use of ethnicity-specific thresholds for CA-125.

        "abstract": "This study investigated the climatic risks and vulnerabilities of informal settlements in the Global South, as well as the extent to which these risks impact the vulnerabilities. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 methodology and deductive content analysis, this study critically examined 69 documents, including 28 scholarly journal articles obtained from Scopus and ScienceDirect and 41 web-based releases identified through the Google search engine and snowballing technique. Document inclusion criteria focused on the relevance to climate risks and vulnerabilities, excluding non-peer-reviewed, non-English, and unreliable sources, as well as irrelevant studies. Seven major climate risks impacting informal settlements were identified: floods (44), temperature changes (41), storms (31), sea level rise (30), drought (28), rainfall (23), and landslides (14). The primary vulnerabilities highlighted were poor housing conditions (64), health risks (50), lack of basic services (49), inadequate sanitation (41), inadequate hygiene (39), and limited access to water (38). The combination of vulnerabilities and climate risks creates considerable direct, indirect, and low-level threats to informal settlements. Despite Asia, Africa, and Latin America’s vulnerability, most studies focused on formal and developed areas. The findings highlight the critical need for climate adaptation strategies in informal settlements of the Global South to ensure the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are met.",

        "title": "Features of the functioning of numerals in the substandard lexicon of the African American social and ethnic dialect",
        "abstract": "Language, as an essential means of communication, is a constantly evolving system of sign units. It develops in accordance with established rules and laws, reflecting the living dynamics of society. Reflecting the character of the people, their thinking, culture, each language forms its own mechanism for expressing quantity. Addressing the problems of studying the number structure within a separate social and communicative system in close connection with the surrounding reality is relevant today. The purpose of this work is to study the specifics of the use of numer als in the vocabulary of the African American population of the United States. The research material was substandard lexical units with the numeral name component, obtained from English-language text sources: explanatory dictionaries of the American version of English, general American and African American slang, texts of musical compositions, Internet resources. The works of E. I. Putyatina, Yu. V. Bopp on the consideration of numerals, J. Dillard, J. Smitherman on the study of the African American Social and Ethnic Dialect formed the theoretical and methodological basis of this work. The methods of empirical observation and continuous sampling, statistical and contextual analysis are used in the work to identify functional, historical, socio-cultural aspects of the use of numerals in the colloquial speech of African Americans. The analysis of the expression of the potential of numerals shows the prominence of the manifestation of informational, influencing and conspiratorial functions. The results suggest that, thanks to metaphorical transference, numerals can be used to express evaluative values, expanding their function in the language.",

        "abstract": "Objective To understand how Long COVID is impacting the health and social conditions of the Black and Latinx communities. Background Emerging research on Long COVID has identified three distinct characteristics, including multi-organ damage, persistent symptoms, and post-hospitalization complications. Given Black and Latinx communities experienced significantly higher COVID rates in the first phase of the pandemic they may be disproportionately impacted by Long COVID. Methods Eleven focus groups were conducted in four languages with diverse Black and Latinx individuals (n = 99) experiencing prolonged symptoms of COVID-19 or caring for family members with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms. Data was analyzed thematically. Results Most participants in non-English language groups reported they were unfamiliar with the diagnosis of long COVID, despite experiencing symptoms. Long COVID impacts spanned financial and housing stability to physical and mental health impacts. Participants reported challenging encounters with health care providers, a lack of support managing symptoms and difficulty performing activities of daily living including work. Conclusions There is a need for multilingual, accessible information about Long COVID symptoms, improved outreach and healthcare delivery, and increased ease of enrollment in long-term disability and economic support programs.

        "abstract": "This study redirects attention from English-speaking African diaspora stand-up productions to French and German language expressions of purposively selected comedians with recent immigration history from Africa performing within mainland Europe. Through a socio-historical interrogation of specific colonial histories and joke themes, the paper comparatively explores the French language stage acts of Fary Lopez, Samia Orosemane (France) and Cécile Djunga (Belgium and France) and the German language works of Dave Davis (Germany), Charles Nguela (Switzerland), and Soso Mugiraneza (Austria). The aim is to show how the individuated colonial histories of the nations in which these comics reside and the chronicles of their relations with Africa(ns) and Black peoples feature in joke formulations and satiric jibes of the jokesters. Through these explorations, this essay studies how stand-up comedy’s transformative power challenges societal norms and attitudes using the backdrop of the concurrently heterogeneous and dissimilar colonial histories of the African continent and its diasporas. Moreover, through its focus on non-English expressions, it presents the unique intersections of language, “race,” ethnicity and colonial histories, as well as the geographic and linguistic spread of the African diaspora beyond European nations with direct colonial contact with the continent. Thus, the enquiry posits joke performances as platforms for cultural expression and critique as well as a site within which African peoples negotiate their presence in non-African environments.",

        "title": "Rethinking decolonized universities: a case for proverbs (Dika le Diema) and Ubuntu in humanizing South African universities",
        "abstract": "The debates over the decolonisation of higher education in South Africa have resulted in differing perspectives on epistemologies and pedagogical techniques. While discussions rage about the conceptualisation and methods of decolonising higher education, as well as the practical efficiency of applying nuanced epistemologies, students continue to face racism, discrimination, and exclusion in higher education institutions. In its broadest sense, the foundation for the conversation on inclusion is founded on the elephant in the room, apartheid, which has been an Achilles heel in the change of South Africa's educational landscape. The apartheid curriculum, in all of its stages, largely prepared workers for low-wage, exploitative work. It showed little concern for emphasising Afrocentric foundations that expanded Black communities' cultural and traditional value systems. Bantu education's harsh social engineering prowess attempted to sidestep African philosophical frameworks (Ubuntu), which are crucial for motivating pupils' confidence, consciousness, and self-actualization. Against this backdrop, this study views decolonisation as a chance to include African languages, value systems, histories, customs, beliefs, cultures, and experiences in higher education.  This paper argues that the abstract inclusion of African languages devoid of intrinsic depth and essence is a patronising exercise purposed to vaguely position African languages alongside English and Afrikaans; doing so prohibits a deeper humanistic appreciation and knowledge of African traditions and indigenous systems. This paper emphasizes the crucial role of African languages and indigenous knowledge systems in addressing racism and inequality, and encourages their gradual and benign incorporation into higher education curricula.",

        "abstract": "Climate change poses unique challenges to maternal well-being and increases complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15–45). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate-responsive policies.",

        "abstract": "Background Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) is a risk factor for non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Understanding the changes in the electromyographic activity of the lower extremity muscles in individuals with DKV helps trainers design ACL injury prevention exercises. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the muscle activation of the lower limb muscles in individuals with DKV during single-leg and overhead squats. Methods Articles with titles, abstracts, and full texts were searched and screened independently by two reviewers in the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, without restrictions on publication date and in English using specified keywords from their inception to January 5, 2024. The quality of articles was evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black quality checklist. This meta-analysis used mean difference (MD) to compare the muscle activity patterns between individual with DKV and healthy individuals. Heterogeneity was detected using I-square (I2) test. Results In total, four papers with 130 participants were included in the study. Evidence showed a significant difference between the DKV group and the healthy group regarding the activities of the adductor magnus (MD: 6.25, P < 0.001), vastus medialis (MD: 13.23, P = 0.002), vastus lateralis (MD: 11.71, P = 0.004), biceps femoris (MD: 3.06, P = 0.003), and tibialis anterior muscles (MD: 8.21, P = 0.02). Additionally, muscle activity in the DKV group was higher than that in the healthy group. Conclusions This meta-analysis reveals distinct muscle activation patterns in individuals with dynamic knee valgus (DKV), with increased activity in key muscles suggesting compensatory responses. These findings underscore the need for targeted rehabilitation to address muscle imbalances and improve knee stability.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the study of language has evolved to explore the intricate nuances that shape our communication. One fascinating aspect of language is the use of idioms, which enable speakers to convey emotions indirectly through metaphorical expression. Although idioms enrich language and enhance its expressiveness and vividness, they often cause difficulties for people learning English. Among the myriad of idioms, those related to colours stand out as vibrant and captivating elements of linguistic diversity. Colour is an objective quality of the material world, encoded by language signs into a diverse array of information. Colour schemes and their designations are universal elements of the larger colour symbolic system, composed of multiple subsystems each with their own function and structure. As carriers of information about the surrounding world, colour designations are meaningful topics for cognitive, psycholinguistic, linguistic, and cultural studies. Understanding the structural and semantic features of colour idioms is essential for unravelling the intricate threads that make up effective communication, especially in the context of business discourse. The purpose of this paper is to delve into the semantic and structural features of colour idioms used in English business discourse. General methods (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, classification), theoretical methods (system analysis), graphical, as well as methods of logical, system-structural analysis and connections, comparative and dialectical approaches have been used. Results. Colour symbolism, like any other, is based on the peculiarities of the human psyche, on various associations, which are based on everyday human experience, fed by mythological, religious and aesthetic views. Examining business idioms with the colour component we can say that the semantics of this component often differ from the semantics of the same colour name in free use. The meanings of different colours in business idioms were scrutinized. A detailed analysis was also carried out and a certain proportion of idioms was determined by structures and colours, and the corresponding diagrams were given. The study shows the prevalence of the blue colour (17%), followed by black (15%), red and white (13% each). The yellow colour appears to be less utilized, constituting only 2% of the analysed idioms. The analysis of the syntactic characteristics of colour idioms has shown the dominance of nominal idioms (80%), followed by verbal idioms (10%) with adjectival making up 6% and the adverbial being represented by 1 lexical unit (4%). The originality of this article lies in the study of the symbolism of colours in terms of their use in business phraseological units, and a detailed structural and semantic analysis of colour idioms used in business discourse. Conclusion. The study underscores the significance of colour idioms within the business vocabulary, emphasizing their relevance. Proficiency in these expressions not only enriches one's linguistic repertoire but also enhances communication skills. Business idioms are an important segment in the business vocabulary. Colour idioms occupy a large share in business phraseology, the study of which requires further research.",

        "abstract": "Background Cancer immunotherapy has made significant progress in recent years, with numerous studies worldwide. Immunotherapy has had a transformative impact on oncology and autoimmune diseases. In the biomedical arena, hydrogels with good properties are widely used in cancer immunotherapy. Our study used bibliometrics to analyze the changing trends in using hydrogels for cancer immunotherapy. Methods From 2013 to 2023, a systematic search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify reviews and articles discussing the applications of hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy. The software CiteSpace was used to visually perform the bibliometric analysis in terms of research trends, countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords. Individual authors’ productivity was assessed with the Lotka’s law. The most relevant publication sources were identified by Bradford’s law. Results A total of 422 English-language publications related to hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy were collected. The number of annual publications increased rapidly after 2021 and remained constant for the past two years. China published the most articles in this field. The institution with the maximum number of published articles was the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China. Chen. Q was the most prolific author, and Liu. Z was the second most published author. In terms of journal contributions, the journal “Biomaterials” had the highest number of publications (n = 30). Biomaterials, Advanced Functional Materials and Journal of Controlled Release were the most influential journals. Keyword analysis revealed that cancer immunotherapy, drug delivery, immunogenic cell death, tumor microenvironment, injectable hydrogels, and immune checkpoint blockade were the primary research hotspots. In recent 3 years, adoptive T-cell therapy, black phosphorus, cell capture, adaptive cell therapy, tumor microenvironment, photodynamic therapy, and sustained release were the research hotspots in this field. Our study summarizes the objective of hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, providing a reference for potential researchers in related field. Conclusion This bibliometric analysis shows the progress and trend of research on hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy. This study provides a significant avenue for future investigation into current concerns and trends in research within this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective Investigate the association between demographic characteristics and emergency department (ED) epistaxis management and outcomes. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting TriNetX US collaborative database. Methods Adults presenting to the ED for epistaxis were retrospectively followed for 7 days. Spanish‐speaking patients were propensity score matched to English‐speaking patients by demographics and medical history. Outcomes included use of nasal decongestant, nasal packing or cautery, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, endoscopic control of hemorrhage, hospital admission, and mortality. The analysis was also performed with stratification by race and ethnicity. Results Spanish‐speaking patients were less likely to receive nasal packing or cautery [odds ratio, OR: 0.78; 95% confidence interval, CI: (0.68; 0.90)] or diagnostic nasal endoscopy [OR: 0.72; 95% CI: (0.52; 0.98)] compared to English‐speaking patients. Black patients were more likely to receive treatment with a nasal decongestant spray [OR: 1.31; 95% CI: (1.27, 1.36)], but less likely to receive any other treatment compared to White patients. Asian patients were less likely to undergo nasal packing or cautery [OR: 0.90; 95% CI: (0.82; 0.99)], but had more ED visits [(1.37; 1.32) P < .01] compared to White patients. Hispanic patients were less likely to be admitted [OR: 0.93; 95% CI: (0.87; 0.98)], and averaged fewer ED visits [(1.27; 1.30) P = <.0001] compared to non‐Hispanic patients. Conclusion While demographic trends in ED epistaxis management are nuanced, our results suggest that Spanish‐speaking, Black, Asian, and Hispanic patients are less likely to receive diagnostic and epistaxis control procedures. Additional research is needed to determine the etiology of these differences.",

        "abstract": ": Research on English language teacher education (ELTE) in Brazil has prioritized qualitative investigations of specific institutional contexts and has overlooked nationwide explorations of ELTE. The present study addresses this research gap through an investigation of cross-institutional ELTE across the country with a focus on its contextual configuration and social inclusion. To this end, the study has undertaken a secondary analysis of the Brazilian federal government’s 2019 higher education census data. The findings show that future English language teachers’ academic socialization takes place primarily in online undergraduate courses with an embedded teaching qualification, offered by private higher education institutions. These online ELTE courses are mainly attended by White students even though the Brazilian population consists predominantly of Blacks. We argue that considerable work needs to be undertaken to change the current configuration of ELTE in Brazil and promote social inclusion. We urge teacher educators to engage in the analysis of census data to contribute to nationwide teacher education policymaking.",

        "abstract": "Background The impact on cardiovascular health is lost when a patient does not obtain a newly prescribed lipid-lowering medication, a situation termed “initial medication nonadherence” (IMN). This research summarizes the published evidence on the prevalence, associated factors, consequences, and solutions for IMN to prescribed lipid-lowering medication in the United States. Methods A systematic literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar, along with screening citations of systematic reviews, identified articles published from 2010 to 2021. Studies reporting results of IMN to lipid-lowering medications were included. Studies that evaluated non-adult or non-US populations, used weaker study designs (e.g., case series), or were not written in English were excluded. Results There were 19 articles/18 studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Estimates of the prevalence of IMN to newly prescribed lipid-lowering medications ranged from 10 to 18.2% of patients and 1.4–43.8% of prescriptions (n = 9 studies). Three studies reported prescriber and patient characteristics associated with IMN. Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, lower Charlson Comorbidity Index score and no ED visits or hospitalization were associated with IMN. Lipid lowering prescriptions from primary care providers were also associated with IMN. Four studies described patient-reported reasons for IMN, including preference for lifestyle modifications, lack of perceived need, and side effect concerns. Four intervention studies reported mixed results with automated calls, live calls, or letters. One study reported worse clinical outcomes in patients with IMN: higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and greater risk of emergency department visits. Conclusions Up to one-fifth of patients fail to obtain a newly prescribed lipid-lowering medication but there is limited information about the clinical consequences. Future research should assess outcomes and determine cost-effective approaches to address IMN to lipid-lowering therapy.",

The translation by Pratt and Jiang has the most annotations and is easiest for the typical English reader to read. With an emphasis on the original language, Sanders' translation demonstrates the translator's goal of translating Chinese culture while veering toward thick translation. Black's translation is particularly unique because the translator frequently adopts the author's tone to infuse the original language with cultural context. The distinct socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds of the translators and the intended audience are the primary causes of the four translations' wildly divergent styles.",

        "abstract": "In 1957 Abbott and Ballantine described a highly toxic activity from a dinoflagellate isolated from the English Channel in 1949 by Mary Park. From a culture maintained at Plymouth Laboratory since 1950, we have been able to isolate two toxic molecules (abbotoxin and 59-E-Chloro-abbotoxin), determine the planar structures by analysis of HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectra, and found them to be karlotoxin (KmTx) congeners. Both toxins kill larval zebrafish with symptoms identical to those described by Abbot and Ballantine for gobies (Gobius virescens). Using surface plasma resonance the sterol binding specificity of karlotoxins is shown to require desmethyl sterols. Our results with black lipid membranes indicate that karlotoxin forms large-conductance channels in the lipid membrane, which are characterized by large ionic conductance, poor ionic selectivity, and a complex gating behavior that exhibits strong voltage dependence and multiple gating patterns. In addition, we show that KmTx 2 pore formation is a highly targeted mechanism involving sterol-specificity. This is the first report of the functional properties of the membrane pores formed by karlotoxins and is consistent with the initial observations of Abbott and Ballantine from 1957.",

        "abstract": "Objectives The purpose of this study was to systematically summarise the empirical evidence on the prevalence of HIV among long-distance truck drivers (LDTDs) from all parts of the world. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Data sources We searched PubMed, ProQuest Central, PubMed Central, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Global Index Medicus to identify relevant information published from 1989 to 16 May 2023. Eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed publications of English language reporting on the prevalence of HIV among LDTDs were included. Non-empirical studies like literature reviews were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis Using a standardised data abstraction form, we extracted information on study characteristics and HIV prevalence levels. Crude prevalence estimates per 100 participants were computed and later transformed using logit transformation to have them follow a normal distribution. A meta-analysis of prevalences using the random effects model was performed. The I2 statistic was used to quantify the degree of heterogeneity across studies. A subgroup analysis using meta-regression was performed to investigate factors that could explain variability across studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute tools and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of the included studies. To assess the certainty of evidence, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used. Results Of the 1787 articles identified, 42 were included. Most of the included studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (45.23%, n=19) and Asia and the Pacific (35.71%, n=15). The pooled prevalence of HIV was 3.86%, 95% CI (2.22% to 6.64%). The burden of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 14.34%, 95% CI (9.94% to 20.26%), followed by Asia and the Pacific at 2.12%, 95 CI (0.94% to 4.7%) and lastly Western, Central Europe and North America at 0.17%, 95% CI (0.03% to 0.82%). The overall heterogeneity score was (I2=98.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion The global burden of HIV among LDTDs is 3.86%, six times higher than that of the general population globally. Compared with other regions, the burden of HIV is highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 14.34%, where it is estimated to be 3% in the general population. Thus, LDTDs endure a disproportionately high burden of HIV compared with other populations. Consequently, more LDTD-centred HIV research and surveillance is needed at national and regional levels to institute tailored preventive policies and interventions.

        "abstract": "Introduction Inequities in COVID-19 infection and vaccine uptake among historically marginalised racial and ethnic groups in the USA persist. Individuals with rheumatic conditions, especially those who are immunocompromised, are especially vulnerable to severe infection, with significant racialised inequities in infection outcomes and in vaccine uptake. Structural racism, historical injustices and misinformation engender racial and ethnic inequities in vaccine uptake. The Popular Opinion Lleader (POL) model, a community-based intervention that trains trusted community leaders to disseminate health information to their social network members (eg, friends, family and neighbours), has been shown to reduce stigma and improve care-seeking behaviours. Methods and analysis This is a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial led by a team of community and academic partners to compare the efficacy of training POLs with rheumatic or musculoskeletal conditions using a curriculum embedded with a racial justice vs a biomedical framework to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake and reduce vaccine hesitancy. This trial began recruitment in February 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, USA. Eligible POLs are English-speaking adults who identify as Black and/or of African descent, have a diagnosis of a rheumatic or musculoskeletal condition and have received >=1 COVID-19 vaccine after 31 August 2022. POLs will be randomised to a 6-module virtual educational training; the COVID-19 and vaccine-related content will be the same for both groups however the framing for arm 1 will be with a racial justice lens and for arm 2, a biomedical preventative care-focused lens. Following the training, POLs will disseminate the information they learned to 12–16 social network members who have not received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine, over 4 weeks. The trial’s primary outcome is social network member COVID-19 vaccine uptake, which will be compared between intervention arms. Ethics and dissemination This trial has ethical approval in the USA. This has been approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (IRB, 2023P000686), the Northwestern University IRB (STU00219053), the Boston University/Boston Medical Center IRB (H-43857) and the Boston Children’s Hospital IRB (P00045404).

        "abstract": "Purpose To elucidate the impact of demographics, including gender, race, ethnicity, and preferred language, on regional visual field (VF) loss and progression in glaucoma. Methods Multivariable linear mixed regressions were performed to determine the impact of race, ethnicity, and preferred language on regional VF loss with adjustment for age and gender. Regional VF loss was defined by pointwise total deviation values and VF loss patterns quantified by an unsupervised machine learning method termed archetypal analysis. All cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed both without and with adjustment for VF mean deviation, which represented overall VF loss severity. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Results All results mentioned had corrected P values less than 0.05. Asian and Black patients showed worse pointwise VF loss than White patients with superior hemifield more affected. Patients with a preferred language other than English demonstrated worse pointwise VF loss than patients with English as their preferred language. Longitudinal analyses revealed Black patients showed worse VF loss/year compared to White patients. Patients with a preferred language other than English demonstrated worse VF loss/year compared to patients preferring English. Conclusions Blacks and non-English speakers have more severe VF loss, with superior hemifield being more affected and faster VF worsening. Translational Relevance This study furthered our understanding of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in glaucoma outcomes. Understanding the VF loss burden in different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups may guide more effective glaucoma screening and community outreach efforts. This research could help reduce vision loss and improve quality of life in disproportionately affected populations by guiding public health efforts to promote glaucoma awareness and access to care.",

Here, we illustrate 2nd and 3rd grade children's qualitative patterns of performance on arithmetic tasks in relation to their AAE dialect use and elaborate a unified framework for examining child and item level linguistic characteristics. Results suggest that children draw upon their emerging (bi)dialectal repertoire with arithmetic problems when selecting appropriate problem-solving strategies on language-formatted problems. The mismatch of assessment language formatting with children's repertoires may disadvantage AAE speakers' strategy selections and result in a language-based performance disadvantage unrelated to mathematical ability. Research designs that look beyond correct/incorrect scoring to examine qualitative patterns of performance in AAE speaking children can provide valuable and oft-overlooked evidence when considering equity in mathematics assessment formats.",

        "abstract": "Background: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is an underrecognized chronic inflammatory skin condition with significant clinical features and potential for malignant transformation. To date, there are no studies comparing the course of this disease in women of color to other racial groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to provide a scoping review examining racial demographic data in VLS treatment studies and specifically assessing for the inclusion of women of color. Methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a primary literature search was conducted using 4 databases: Ovid Medline(R), Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science from all years to December 2022. We included published studies with adult women diagnosed with VLS and containing a treatment arm using topical corticosteroids. Single case reports, literature reviews, systemic reviews, meta-analyses, and reports not available in English were excluded. Results: Overall, 1340 nonduplicate studies were assessed for eligibility criteria. In total, 65 publications were included. Only 6 included racial demographic data. Black women made up at most 3.8% of the sample population and Latinx women made up at most 5.7%. Limitations: Our review focused on a specific intervention (ie, the use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of VLS), which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other interventions. No risk of bias assessment was done due to the scoping nature of the review. Conclusion: Women of color are underrepresented in studies of topical corticosteroid use in adult women with VLS. Intentional diversity in recruitment will enable the collection of data that is both more accurate and reflective of a broader spectrum of perspectives and life experiences.",

        "abstract": "Drawing on theories of aversive racism and colour-blindness, which stress the invisibility of contemporary racism, this article analyses online discussions on taking the knee (TTK) during EURO2020 men’s football tournament. While highly visible racist abuse directed at Black English players after losing the final to Italy (dominative racism) received most public attention and repudiation, based on 6,850 English language tweets published on Twitter/X, this article shows how subtle racism and colour-blindness were reinforced in discussions around TTK over the duration of the tournament (aversive racism). The article also shows how individuals online developed a variety of strategies (evidence, othering, critique, and activism) to challenge the main arguments against anti-racist activism in football (identified in four themes: BLM, Marxism, virtue signalling, and woke). The article makes an original contribution by examining the changing intensity of online conversations on TTK over the duration of the tournament. Our analysis identifies key moments in the tournament, political elites’ rhetoric, and trends of success and failure as relevant factors that shaped vernacular conversations online. The discussion ultimately argues that investigating the temporal patterns of public discussions on (anti)racism provides valuable insights to understand the contemporary complexity of racism in football and society more broadly.",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the nature of morphological processes of colour terms among the users of English in Nigeria and their syntactic usages using a multi-dimensional approach in data gathering. The data was drawn from one hundred subjects across ten ethnic groups, including Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba as well as fifteen textual materials written in English by Nigerian scholars. The paper adopts a cognitive linguistic multidimensional framework. The paper reveals that the colour systems and usages among Nigerians contrast with the system within the native speakers of the language. For instance \"fresh leave green\", \"pale blue\", \"blood red\", \"yolk yellow\", \"black black\", \"dark so and so\", \"charcoal\", \"flesh\", , \"dirty green\", \"dudu\" and so on are formed through several morphological processes such as coining, clipping, blending, borrowing, compounding, reduplication and affixation as well as usage in various syntactic operations as in nominals and adjectives: \"The shirt is dark so and so.\" and \"The yellows ran out of the scorching sun.\" which serves as adjective and nominal plural respectively. Hence the paper concludes that morphology and syntax of most colours in Nigerian context have been influenced by many indigenous languages in the country. Hence, the hierarchy of the basic colours violates the Berlin and Kay\"s evolutionary sequence and Kay and Maffi\"s Trajectory model of Colour terms within the circle of the native speakers of English.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence of HIV-related stigma among people with HIV (PWH) in Switzerland Design: A cross-sectional multicenter study nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). Methods: We included adult PWH enrolled in the SHCS, attending follow-up between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Inability to speak English, French, German, or Italian was the only exclusion criterion. Participants were invited to complete a validated 12-item HIV-stigma questionnaire comprising four stigma subscales (negative self-image, personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, and concerns regarding public attitudes), plus two healthcare-related stigma items. Questionnaire responses were graded using a four-point Likert-type scale, higher scores indicating higher stigma. “Non-applicable,” inferring HIV-status non-disclosure, was possible for personalized stigma; stigma scores from participants answering “non-applicable” to at least one item were analyzed separately. Factors associated with HIV-stigma were identified through multivariable linear models. Results: Of 9643 PWH with a SHCS visit, 5563 participated in the study: 26% were female, 13% Black, and 37% heterosexual; median age was 53 years (interquartile range 44–59); 2067 participants (37%) gave at least one “non-applicable” response. Disclosure concerns had the highest stigma scores and were reported by 4656/5563 (84%). HIV-stigma was reported across all demographic groups. However, being female, Black, and heterosexual were independently associated with higher scores. Higher education and longer follow-up duration were associated with lower scores. Healthcare-related stigma was reported in 37% of participants. Conclusion: HIV-stigma was prevalent across all demographic groups. The association with being female and Black suggests that HIV-stigma accentuates preexisting sex and race inequalities.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Poor prenatal health is of particular concern among minoritized individuals who may experience adverse social determinants of health contributing to the intergenerational transmission of health disparities. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between psychosocial resources, and mental and physical health among a prenatal sample, and to explore if these relationships vary by race. Methods English-speaking pregnant individuals living in the United States were recruited using Centiment (n=340). Participants completed a 121-item cross-sectional survey. We conducted a single- and multi-group structural equation model to test hypothesized relationships, and then investigated differences by pregnant White individuals versus Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Results Our final single-group model exhibited good model fit (χ2 (43) = 99.07, p<.01, CFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.04, and RMSEA = 0. 06 (0.05 – 0.08)). After controlling for demographic characteristics and social determinants of health, higher levels of mindfulness were statistically significantly related to lower anxiety and depression scores (both p<.01). Higher levels of social supports were statistically significantly related to lower anxiety scores. Scale measurement invariance was confirmed for the multi-group model and the structural model was statistically significantly different between pregnant White individuals and BIPOC in this sample (Δ χ2 (27) = 116.71, p <.01). Conclusions Identification of core components of psychosocial resource interventions, consideration of upstream structural determinants, mindfulness and valued-living (MVL)-based strategies, cultural adaptation, and an emphasis on resilience rather than psychopathology may result in improved prenatal health among pregnant individuals traditionally underrepresented in research.",

        "abstract": "Background Post-stroke upper limb (UL) motor improvement is associated with adaptive neuroplasticity and motor learning. Both intervention-related (including provision of intensive, variable, and task-specific practice) and individual-specific factors (including the presence of genetic polymorphisms) influence improvement. In individuals with stroke, most commonly, polymorphisms are found in Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Apolipoprotein (APOE) and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT). These involve a replacement of cystine by arginine (APOEε4) or valines by 1 or 2 methionines (BDNF:val66met, met66met; COMT:val158met; met158met). However, the implications of these polymorphisms on post-stroke UL motor improvement specifically have not yet been elucidated. Objective Examine the influence of genetic polymorphism on post-stroke UL motor improvement. Design Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in English language. The modified Downs and Black checklist helped assess study quality. We compared change in UL motor impairment and activity scores between individuals with and without the polymorphisms. Meta-analyses helped assess change in motor impairment (Fugl Meyer Assessment) scores based upon a minimum of 2 studies/time point. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified based upon the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System as follows: small (0.08-0.18), medium (0.19 -0.40) and large (≥0.41). Results We retrieved 10 (4 good and 6 fair quality) studies. Compared to those with BDNF val66met and met66met polymorphism, meta-analyses revealed lower motor impairment (large ES) in those without the polymorphism at intervention completion (0.5, 95% CI: 0.11-0.88) and at retention (0.58, 95% CI:0.06-1.11). The presence of CoMT val158met or met158met polymorphism had similar results, with lower impairment (large ES ≥1.5) and higher activity scores (large ES ranging from 0.5-0.76) in those without the polymorphism. Presence of APOEε4 form did not influence UL motor improvement. Conclusion Polymorphisms with the presence of 1 or 2 met alleles in BDNF and COMT negatively influence UL motor improvement.

        "abstract": "After the British occupation (1806) the population of Cape Town had grown slowly; by 1829 the mother-city had more than 18 000 inhabitants comprising influential English traders, Dutch-speaking persons, Free Blacks and slaves. The general hygiene of the town was bad while health services left much to be desired. Living conditions of Poor Whites and Free Blacks were most unsatisfactory and had been aggravated by poverty, poor housing, diseases, and even epidemics. Ordinance 50, promulgated in 1828, placed the indigenous peoples on an equal footing with their European counterparts and integration was also socially acceptable. Yet the society was still dependent on a system of slavery and racial differentiation was still appreciable. The inadequate harbour facilities also retarded trade and general progress. Streets were dusty and unlit and the open canals (\"grachts\") were in a filthy and insanitary state. A few tiny suburbs (e.g. Sea Point and Wynberg) existed at this stage; local government in Cape Town was exercised by a government appointed magistrate and officials. A Supreme Court was created and in 1829 ten advocates and eleven attorneys practised in Cape Town. In contrast to the relatively poor social conditions, inhabitants enjoyed the benefits of ample educational and religious facilities. The cultural life of Cape Town flourished and fair provision was made for entertainment and recreation. By 1829 Cape Town was indeed a town beginning to develop a new character, mainly as a result of the influence of British immigrants.",

        "title": "AI-Driven Watermarking Technique for Safeguarding Text Integrity in the Digital Age",
        "abstract": "The internet’s growth has led to a surge in text usage. Now, with public access to generative AI models like ChatGPT/Bard, identifying the source is vital. This is crucial due to concerns about copyright infringement and plagiarism. Moreover, it is essential to differentiate AI-generated text to curb misinformation from AI model hallucinations.In this paper, we explore text watermarking as a potential solution, focusing on plain ASCII text in English. We investigate techniques including physical watermarking (e.g., UniSpaCh by Por et al.), which modifies text to hide a binary message using Unicode Spaces, and logical watermarking (e.g., word context by Jalil et al.), which generates a watermark key via a defined process. While logical watermarking is difficult to break but undetectable without prior knowledge, physical watermarks are easily detected but also easy to break.This paper presents a unique physical watermarking technique based on word substitution to address these challenges. The core idea is that AI models consistently produce the same output for the same input. Initially, we replaced every i-th word (for example, every 5th word) with a “[MASK],” a placeholder token used in natural language processing models to indicate where a word has been removed and needs to be predicted. Then, we used a BERT model to predict the most probable token in place of “[MASK].” The resulting text constitutes the watermarked text. To verify, we reran the algorithm on the watermarked text and compared the input and output for similarity.The Python implementation of the algorithm in this paper employs models from the HuggingFace Transformer Library, namely “bert-base-uncased” and “distilroberta-base”. The “[MASK]” placeholder was generated by splitting the input string using the split() function and then replacing every 5th element in the list with “[MASK]”. This modified list served as the input text for the BERT model, where the output corresponding to each “[MASK]” was replaced accordingly. Finally, applying the join() function to the list produces the watermarked text.This technique tends to generate nearly invisible watermarked text, preserving its integrity or completely changing the meaning of the text based on how similar the text is to the training dataset of BERT. This was observed when the algorithm was run on the story of Red Riding Hood, where its meaning was altered. However, the nature of this watermark makes it extremely difficult to break due to the black-box nature of the AI model.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nProstate cancer (CaP) disproportionately affects 1-in-4 Black men and is a stigmatised disease within their communities. Yet, Black men are underrepresented in CaP research concerning stigma, which necessitates a scoping review to map available evidence on this topic to inform future research.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo map published literature on stigma related to CaP in Black men to understand their experiences and/or perceptions and identify directions for future research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA scoping review was conducted using the five-step framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Studies published in English addressing stigma related to CaP from the perspectives of Black men and/or their families were included. We searched six databases including Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection and Google Scholar, from inception to April 2023. Citation searches were also conducted. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. Data was synthesised using descriptive content analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four eligible studies conducted in the USA, UK, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Cameroon and Canada from 1995 to 2023 were included. A total of 1867 Black men with/without a CaP diagnosis and 145 adult partners were included. Review findings showed a complex intersection of self-stigma, public stigma and structural stigma impacted Black men's perceptions of their masculinity. While men's experiences/perceptions of stigma varied depending on their illness status, there were commonalities in their masculinity concerns (underpinned by stigma), which influenced their attitude towards digital rectal examination, post-treatment side effects and social interactions on CaP. These have implications for public health messaging on CaP within Black communities, as well as patient-provider interactions with the men.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis novel review highlights the need to pay attention to how CaP is presented to Black men and their communities using avenues and languages that are culturally acceptable and empower them to negotiate self-stigma, public stigma and structural stigma related to CaP. Directions for further research were also identified.",

        "abstract": "Background Vaccination has been recommended as one of the most potent ways of controlling the mpox (formerly, monkeypox) outbreak, particularly among high-risk groups. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of mpox vaccine acceptance and uptake globally. Methods We searched multiple databases for peer-reviewed studies published in English from May 2022 to 25th November 2023 that evaluated mpox vaccine acceptance and/or uptake. We fit a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled mpox vaccine acceptance and uptake rates, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) across population outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses among the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Africa [AFR], Region of the Americas [AMR], South-East Asia Region [SEAR], European Region [EUR], Eastern Mediterranean Region [EMR], and the Western Pacific Region [WPR]), as well as among select population subgroups. Results Of the 2531 studies screened, 61 studies, with a cumulative sample size of 263,857 participants from 87 countries were eligible for inclusion. The overall vaccine acceptance and uptake rates were 59.7% and 30.9% globally. Acceptance and uptake rates among the LGBTQI+ community were 73.6% vs 39.8% globally, 60.9% vs. 37.1% in AMR, 80.9% vs. 50.0% in EUR, and 75.2% vs. 33.5% in WPR. Among PLHIV, vaccine acceptance and uptake rates were 66.4% vs. 35.7% globally, 64.0% vs. 33.9% in AMR, 65.1% vs. 27.0% in EUR, and 69.5% vs. 46.6% in WPR. Among healthcare workers, vaccination intention was 51.0% globally. Conclusions Tailored interventions are needed to bolster confidence in the mpox vaccine, maximize vaccine uptake, and increase vaccine access to close the gaps between acceptance and uptake especially among key populations residing in regions with low rates of acceptance and uptake.",

It is imperative for higher education institutions to reevaluate language-related practices and foster linguistic diversity and equity. Drawing upon linguistic theories and real-world examples, I highlight how language is deeply intertwined with personal identity, culture, and heritage. Various English dialects, such as African American Vernacular English, Chicano English, and others, are highlighted as valid linguistic expressions rather than deviations from a supposed standard. The role of standard academic English (SAE) in academia is examined, with a critical examination of how it can unintentionally perpetuate linguistic prejudice and inequality. I highlight activities in one university and provide practical strategies and classroom approaches to promote linguistic equity by showcasing rubric adjustments and teaching techniques that accommodate diverse language backgrounds. Educators can create inclusive learning environments that empower students to communicate effectively and celebrate their linguistic diversity, ultimately breaking free from historically biased language standards.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Disparities in cervical cancer screening rates among marginalized groups is a driver of inequalities in cervical cancer. Self‐sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a newly emerging alternative to clinician‐performed testing to screen for cervical cancer, and has high potential to reduce screening barriers in under‐screened and marginalized groups. We study the acceptability in of HPV self‐sampling and informational materials among Black/African American, Hispanic/Spanish speaking, American Indian/Alaska Native and transgender/nonbinary populations. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with patients, ages 30–65, who were Black/African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and/or transgender/nonbinary individuals assigned female at birth. Telephone interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. Patients did not complete the test, rather were asked about the attractiveness, comprehensibility, and acceptability of the HPV self‐test, instructions, and messaging. Results Among 23 completed interviews (5 American Indian/Alaska Native, 7 Hispanic [2 bilingual, 5 Spanish‐speaking], 5 Black/African American, and 6 transgender/nonbinary), patients from all groups thought the test was straightforward and convenient, and they would complete the test at home or in clinic. The transgender/nonbinary patients preferred at‐home testing. American Indian and transgender/nonbinary patients liked that the test might avoid pain, discomfort, and invasiveness. All patients liked the letter and instructions. All groups had specific suggestions for making the materials more culturally acceptable. Conclusions The HPV self‐test and the instructions and materials for use were acceptable for a diverse group of patients. Tailored outreach and messaging should be considered to reduce screening disparities among groups that have been historically underserved by the medical system.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The association between fluoroquinolone intake and Achilles tendinopathy (AT) or Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) is widely documented. However, it is not clear whether different molecules have the same effect on these complications. The purpose of this study was to document Achilles tendon complications for the most prescribed fluoroquinolones molecules. Methods A literature search was performed on Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to April 2023. Inclusion criteria: studies of any level of evidence, written in English, documenting the prevalence of AT/ATR after fluoroquinolone consumption and stratifying the results for each type of molecule. The Downs and Black’s ‘Checklist for Measuring Quality’ was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Results Twelve studies investigating 439,299 patients were included (59.7% women, 40.3% men, mean age: 53.0 ± 15.6 years). The expected risk of AT/ATR was 0.17% (95% CI: 0.15–0.19, standard error (s.e.): 0.24) for levofloxacin, 0.17% (95% CI: 0.16–0.19, s.e.: 0.20) for ciprofloxacin, 1.40% (95% CI: 0.88–2.03, s.e.: 2.51) for ofloxacin, and 0.31% (95% CI: 0.23–0.40, s.e.: 0.77) for the other molecules. The comparison between groups documented a significantly higher AT/ATR rate in the ofloxacin group (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed the same risk (P = n.s.). The included studies showed an overall good quality. Conclusion Ofloxacin demonstrated a significantly higher rate of AT/ATR complications in the adult population, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed a safer profile compared to all the other molecules. More data are needed to identify other patient and treatment-related factors influencing the risk of musculoskeletal complications.",

The eligibility criteria for 196 Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) trials funded by the National Institute on Aging were analyzed to identify common criteria and their potential to disproportionately exclude participants by race/ethnicity. The trials were categorized by type (48 Phase I/II pharmacological, 7 Phase III/IV pharmacological, 128 non-pharmacological, 7 diagnostic, and 6 neuropsychiatric) and target population (51 AD/ADRD, 58 Mild Cognitive Impairment, 25 at-risk, and 62 cognitively normal). Eligibility criteria were coded into the following categories: Medical, Neurologic, Psychiatric, and Procedural. A literature search was conducted to describe the prevalence of disparities for eligibility criteria for African Americans/Black (AA/B), Hispanic/Latino (H/L), American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NH/PI) populations. The trials had a median of 15 criteria. The most frequent criterion were age cutoffs (87% of trials), specified neurologic (65%), and psychiatric disorders (61%). Underrepresented groups could be disproportionately excluded by 16 eligibility categories; 42% of trials specified English-speakers only in their criteria. Most trials (82%) contain poorly operationalized criteria (i.e., criteria not well defined that can have multiple interpretations/means of implementation) and criteria that may reduce racial/ethnic enrollment diversity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe number of tuberculosis (TB)-related morbidities and mortalities is still high in the South-east Asian region. This study was performed to characterize and visualize the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) TB research in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized. A total of 4822 documents were included in the final analysis according to the predefined eligibility criteria. The data were exported to the R package and VOSviewer software for factorial analysis and network visualization, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe included documents were published in English between 2020 and 2024 in 1255 journals. These documents were authored by 17005 authors (3.53 authors/document). The authors collaboration index was noticed 3.61. In total, 74.16% documents were published as the article. The highest number of documents were published in 2022 (n = 1089). The documents published in 2020 received the highest number of mean total citations per article (n = 8.64). The most published journal was Cureus Journal of Medical Science (n = 228). The most prolific author was Gupta A (n = 115). The most active institution was the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (n = 587). The top most trending topics were Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB elimination, molecular docking, extrapulmonary TB, Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, and multidrug resistance. India was the most productive country and had the strongest research collaboration with the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), and South Africa. Pakistan was mainly collaborating with the USA, the UK, Saudi Arabia, and China. The India and Pakistan collaboration was observed only in 66 documents.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is a poor output of scientific publication on TB in most SAARC countries. However, it is recognized that India has produced the highest number of scientific publications. The detection of undiagnosed post-COVID-19 pandemic TB cases is crucial to control further cases in the region. An effective regional cooperation should be established among institutions, universities, and countries to achieve the World Health Organization End TB goals.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have investigated paternal characteristics in relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and results are inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to review studies examining associations between characteristics of Black fathers and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the United States. A systematic narrative synthesis was conducted of research studies examining paternal characteristics of Black fathers in association with adverse pregnancy outcomes: preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, spontaneous abortion, and maternal mortality. Seven databases (Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for original research articles from inception to February 2023. Articles were excluded if they (a) were in a language other than English, (b) did not describe original research, (c) included a geographic region outside of the United States, (d) did not include adverse maternal outcomes as a study outcome, (e) did not describe race of fathers in the study sample, and (f) did not describe a paternal characteristic of Black fathers. The search resulted in 210 articles. Six studies were included in the final review; five studies examined associations between paternal characteristics of Black fathers and preterm birth, finding significantly increased odds of preterm birth among births with Black fathers. Among births with non-Hispanic Black paternity, the odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were reduced or not significantly associated. Researchers should continue to explore paternal factors that influence pregnancy outcomes in racial/ethnic-specific models to identify optimal intervention strategies to improve disparities in maternal and child health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The present review was aimed to describe the prevalence and the regional distribution of malocclusion among preschool children worldwide. Two independent reviewers performed a systematic literature search to identify English publications from January 2010 to May 2024 using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Embase. Search MeSH key words were “malocclusion”, “primary dentition” and “child, preschool”. The reporting quality was assessed by the modified Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. We identified 2599 publications and recruited 47 articles. Fourteen of the included studies were conducted in Asia, four in Europe, twenty-eight in South America and one in Africa. The prevalence of malocclusion ranged from 28.4% to 83.9%, and half of the reported prevalences were higher than 50%. The highest percentage was in Asia (61.81%), followed by Europe (61.50%), South America (52.69%) and Africa (32.50%). Statistically significant differences existed in deep overbite, anterior open bite, posterior crossbite, edge-to-edge incisor relationship and distal step between continents (p < 0.05). Europe showed the highest prevalence (33.08%) of deep overbite. Africa showed the highest prevalence (18.60%) of anterior open bite. Europe showed the highest prevalence (15.38%) of posterior crossbite. The most common malocclusion traits were increased overjet and deep overbite. To conclude, malocclusion remained prevalent in the primary dentition and varied between countries.",

        "title": "Beyond the Prescription Pad—Finding a Window of Opportunity to Prevent Antibiotic Diversion and Non-Prescription Use",
        "abstract": "Background: Non-prescription antibiotic use is defined as taking antibiotics without medical guidance, which includes using leftover antibiotics, obtaining antibiotics from friends or relatives, or purchasing antibiotics without a prescription. This study aimed to (1) determine the symptoms prompting individuals to use non-prescription antibiotics, identify their sources of acquisition, and document the types of antibiotics utilized, (2) identify any associated side effects, and (3) gain insights into antibiotic storage practices, including whether antibiotics were used beyond their expiration date. Methods: A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted from January 2020-June 2021 in waiting rooms of six safety-net primary care clinics and two private emergency departments in Houston, Texas. Participants were read survey questions in English or Spanish by a bilingual research coordinator, and their responses to five questions about antibiotic use were recorded. Descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Among the 564 patients surveyed, the median age was 51 (range 19-92). The majority identified as female (72%), Hispanic/Latinx (47%), Black/African American (33%), held a college education (44%), and received public health insurance, such as Medicaid or County Financial Assistance (56%). Of all patients surveyed, 44% (246) reported taking an antibiotic without a prescription and answered questions about associated symptoms. Of all symptoms/illnesses associated with non-prescription use, the most common were sore throat (18%), dental symptoms (16%), and cold/flu (13%). The most common sources for non-prescribed antibiotics were leftover antibiotics (50%), from friends or relatives (31%), and purchased abroad (13%), although 3% had purchased non-prescription antibiotics from a local store or market (Figure 1). The most common antibiotics used were amoxicillin (38%) and penicillin (7%). The reported side effects were stomach pain/upset (24%), nausea and vomiting (19%), allergic reaction (e.g., rash) (14%), and diarrhea (14%). Among 246 participants reporting antibiotic use, 63% reported that the antibiotic they took had been previously prescribed for the same symptom/illness, and 93% had acquired antibiotics in a container, of which 90% reported that the container had an expiration date. Conclusions: Our survey reveals that 63% of individuals who use non-prescription antibiotics were motivated by having received prescribed antibiotics for similar symptoms previously. Leftover antibiotics were the source for half of all non-prescription use. These observations suggest that outpatient antibiotic stewardship campaigns have a window of opportunity at the time of the initial prescription of antibiotics, to focus on providing the shortest course possible, and to deliver antibiotic safe use information at that time.

        "abstract": "Introduction The study examines the feasibility, quality of counseling, and knowledge after a virtual Group Contraception Counseling (GCC) session. Methods At an urban academic hospital, we recruited English-speaking pregnant women aged 15–49 who had access to a video-enabled electronic device. Participants engaged in a standardized 45-minute educational session about contraceptive methods in groups of two to five persons conducted over a video conferencing platform. The primary outcome was participant perceived quality of contraception counseling measured by the Person-Centered Contraception Counseling (PCCC) scale. The secondary outcomes were knowledge change before and after counseling, and postpartum contraception uptake. We used an adjusted multivariable linear regression model to analyze knowledge scores. Results Twenty-two participants completed the study. Participants identified primarily as Black or Hispanic/Latinx (78%), in a partnership (50%), having completed college (59%), and having an annual income of less than $50,000 (78%). A total of 77% of participants recorded a perfect score for quality of counseling using the Person-Centered Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) scale. There was an increase in knowledge after counseling (Mean difference (M)=0.07, p<0.01). Notably, certain subsets of participants had decrease in knowledge scores after counseling. Participants who used postpartum contraception were more likely to have increase in knowledge after counseling compared to those who did not (Mean difference (M)=0.09, p<0.01). Conclusion Our findings suggest virtual group contraception counseling is feasible for providing high-quality counseling and can possibly increase contraceptive knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Contexte et objectif: Les enfants nés avant le terme constituent une population à haut risque de retard de développement  neurologique. Les données concernant le neurodeveloppement des enfants nés prématurés dans les pays en voie de développement,  ainsi que les facteurs associés sont encore insuffisantes. La présente étude a évalué le neurodéveloppement des enfants nés prématurésà 6 mois d’âge corrigé. \nMéthodes:  Il s’agissait d’une étude de suivi prospectif à visée analytique qui s’est déroulée dans les hôpitaux sélectionnés de la ville de  Kinshasa de janvier à décembre 2022. Les prématurés ont été enrôlés à leur admission (M0) et ont bénéficié d’une évaluation du neurodéveloppement à 6 mois d’âge corrigé au moyen de l’échelle «ASQ3» \nRésultats: Au total 132 nouveau-nés prématurés ont été enrôlés dans les 3 sites. Le terme moyen était de 33 semaines, le sex ratio M/F était de 0,96; le poids variait entre 900 et 2350gr. Les  principales pathologies évoquées étaient l’infection néonatale (93,2 %), l’hypoglycémie (15,2 %) et l’hémorragie intracrânienne (7,6%).  Sur 132 prématurés recrutés, 11 étaient décédés en période néonatale (8,3%). Après la sortie des hôpitaux, 5 étaient décédés, 49 perdus  de vue et 2 refus de suivi. Seuls 65 enfants étaient évalués à 6 mois d’âge corrigé. Le score d’ASQ3 a révélé qu’à 6 mois d’âge corrigé, 73,8  % des nourrissons anciens prématurés avaient présenté un neurodéveloppement normal et 26,2% avaient un neurodéveloppement  anormal (zone grise et/ou noire). Les facteurs associés aux troubles du neurodéveloppement comprenaient: le terme < 32 semaines, la  naissance par césarienne, l’APGAR <7 à la 5ème minute de vie et l’hypoglycémie. \nConclusion: Le suivi du neurodéveloppement du prématuré reste difficile dans notre contexte de vie. La naissance avant 32 semaines par césarienne et l’hypoglycémie exposent l’enfant  en croissance à une perturbation du neurodéveloppement.  \n  \nEnglish title: Neurodevelopmental outcome at 6 months of corrected age of children born prematurely: an analytical prospective longitudinal follow-up study in Kinshasa \nContext and objective: Children born preterm are a population at high risk of neurodevelopmental delay. There is still a lack of  knowledge about the neurodevelopment of preterm infants in developing countries and the factors associated with preterm birth. The present study evaluated the neurodevelopment of children born preterm at 6 months corrected age. \nMethods: This was a prospective  analytic follow-up study that took place in selected hospitals from January to December 2022. Prematured newborns were enrolled upon admission and received an assessment of neurodevelopment at 6 months (M6) of corrected age using the \"ASQ3\"scale. \nResults: A total  of 132 preterm neonates were enrolled at 3 sites. Mean term was 33 weeks, M/F sex ratio was 0.96; mean weight ranged from  900-2350gr. Out of 132 preterm infants recruited, 11 died in the neonatal period (8.3%). After discharge from hospitals, 5 died, 49 were lost to follow-up and 2 were denied follow-up. Only 65 children were assessed at 6 months of corrected age. The ASQ3 score revealed that  at 6 months corrected age, 73.8 % former preterm infants showed normal neurodevelopment and 26.2% had abnormal  neurodevelopment (gray and/or black areas). \nConclusion: Monitoring neurodevelopment in premature infants remains difficult in our  context.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, maternal health inequities disproportionately affect Global Majority (e.g., Asian, Black, and Hispanic) populations. Despite a substantial body of research underscoring the influence of racism on these inequities, little research has examined how experiences of gendered racial microaggressions during pregnancy and birth impact racially and ethnically diverse Global Majority pregnant and birthing people in obstetric hospital settings. We evaluated the psychometric properties of an adapted version of Lewis & Neville’s Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale, using data collected from 417 Global Majority birthing people. Findings from our study indicate that our adapted GRMS is a valid tool for assessing the experiences of gendered racial microaggressions in hospital-based obstetric care settings among Global Majority pregnant and birthing people whose preferred languages are English or Spanish. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis demonstrated high construct validity of the adapted GRMS scale (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.1089 (95% CI 0.0921, 0.1263), Comparative Fit Index = 0.977, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.075, log-likelihood c2 = -85.6, df = 8). IRT analyses demonstrated that the unidimensional model was preferred to the bi-dimensional model as it was more interpretable, had lower AIC and BIC, and all items had large discrimination parameters onto a single factor (all discrimination parameters > 3.0). Given that we found similar response profiles among Black and Hispanic respondents, our Differential Item Functioning analyses support validity among Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-speaking birthing people. Inter-item correlations demonstrated adequate scale reliability, α = 0.97, and empirical reliability = 0.67. Pearsons correlations was used to assess the criterion validity of our adapted scale. Our scale’s total score was significantly and positively related to postpartum depression and anxiety. Researchers and practitioners should seek to address instances of gendered racial microaggressions in obstetric settings, as they are manifestations of systemic and interpersonal racism, and impact postpartum health.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nRacial differences in prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shifted in the United States (US) since the 1990s. This review addresses the nature and context of this shift and discusses potential contributing factors and areas for future research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventeen population-based epidemiological birth cohort studies on ASD prevalence in the US that included race as a variable are included in the review. Studies were identified via a keyword search on PubMed. To be included, studies were required to include race or ethnicity as a variable in the prevalence estimates, include at least 1000 cases with autism, and be published in English by June 3rd, 2023.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults suggest that in nearly all birth cohorts prior to 2010, ASD prevalence rates were highest among White children. ASD prevalence rates among Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) children (22.3, 22.5, and 22.2 per 1000, respectively) surpassed prevalence rates among White children (21.2 per 1000) in the 2010 birth cohort and continued to increase in the 2012 birth cohorts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are persistent racial differences in ASD prevalence in the US, and these differences were inverted after 2010, when ASD prevalence among Black, Hispanic, & API children surpassed ASD prevalence among White children. Possible drivers of this racial repatterning of ASD prevalence include changes in ASD screening and diagnosis, changes to health insurance policy, changes to immigration policy, and increased education attainment by minority groups.",

        "title": "Perceptions of Maternal Mortality in the Pregnant Missouri Birthing Population",
        "abstract": "Introduction: The US has the highest maternal mortality (MM) rate among developed countries with significant disparities between Black, Hispanic, and Native American birthing people and their White counterparts. Missouri ranks among the 10 states with the highest MM. It has been presumed that the general population’s lack of knowledge surrounding the issue and distrust of the medical system both contribute significantly to MM. Thus, suggestions for improving maternal mortality have been centered primarily around education. To date, there has been a paucity of research surrounding the knowledge and perceptions of MM in the general population. This study sought to understand the perceptions of MM among a representative sample of pregnant people in Missouri. Methods: This is an anonymous, cross-sectional survey conducted from May 2022-August 2022 across the state of Missouri. The Missouri Perinatal Quality Collaborative/ Maternal-Child Learning and Action Network (LAN/PQC) iteratively developed a 46-question survey, distributed in both English and Spanish, to elicit opinions of birthing people in Missouri, assessing their knowledge about state-specific maternal mortality issues. The target population included individuals 18 years and older with a Missouri zip code who identified as someone of birthing potential. Those without a Missouri zip code, who identified as male, and not pregnant were excluded. All survey questions were uploaded into a secure database (REDcap) and accessible to participants through a survey link. The survey was pilot tested by placing a QR code and survey link on social media platforms by the authors. Once feasibility was confirmed, an additional survey link was distributed through an email listserv purchased from a data distribution platform (Dynata). Demographic data, including age, race, pregnancy status, number of lifetime pregnancies, number of living children, and preferred language, were recorded. All survey responses were documented without patient identifiers following signed, informed consent. The survey was aimed to sample 1500 respondents online racially representative of the Missouri birthing population. The study was approved by Saint Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City IRB and was designed to follow STROBE guidelines for the reporting of cross-sectional studies. Participants were asked general knowledge about maternal mortality including whether or not they knew it was a public health issue in Missouri, if they knew someone who died as a result of pregnancy, and if they themselves had ever been concerned about dying as a result of pregnancy. These results were reported as “yes” or “no” responses. Qualifying questions to positive responses included whether the perceived rate of maternal mortality in Missouri was high or low, suspected underlying medical and social causes and timeframe, and personal relationship to the decedent in the case of known death. For those who answered positively about concern for dying in pregnancy, qualifying responses were recorded on a Likert scale (1 for not at all concerned, 2 for a little concerned, 3 for somewhat concerned, 4 for very concerned and 5 for extremely concerned). Respondents were also asked to identify certain groups of people according to race, income status, insurance status, urban versus rural place of residence, educational status, and marital status that may suffer disproportionately from maternal deaths. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4. Descriptive statistics are reported in percentages and counts for categorical outcomes and means ± SD for continuous outcomes. Knowledge questions were analyzed as yes or no responses and reported in frequencies. Perceived etiologies for maternal mortality are reported as nominal data in percentages. Logistic regression was performed utilizing employment status, insurance status, marital status, education attainment, and difficulty with finances as predictors variables. Questions were stratified by age, race, and self-reported zip code. Results: Eighty-five people met inclusion criteria with an average age of 30.4 ± 7.6 and parity of 3.1 ± 2.0. Of those, 65.9% identified as White, 25.9% as Black, 8.2% as Hispanic, 3.5% as Native American, 4.7% as Asian, and 2.4% as Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander. Over 85% reported awareness that MM was an issue in Missouri, and 59.2% reported they believed those numbers to be high. Thirty percent of people reported knowing someone who had died from a pregnancy-related cause; of those, 73.9% reported that the person who died was a family member or personal friend. Only 21.2% of pregnant people reported not being concerned about dying during their pregnancy. Seventy-five percent of the pregnant cohort reported trusting their medical providers’ recommendations. Discussion: Our study found that over 85% of pregnant people in Missouri are aware of MM, and a majority are aware that the MM rate is high. This contradicts commonly held beliefs that our patients’ lack of knowledge may be an opportunity for our efforts. Our survey also revealed that 75% of patients trust their medical providers despite much blame being placed on distrust of the health care system. Further surveys of health care providers may be helpful to reveal how exactly MM can be improved.",

        "abstract": "Frequent use of pain relief medications among patients with migraine can result in disease worsening and medication-overuse headache (MOH), a painful and debilitating condition. We sought to conduct a cross-sectional survey among adult patients diagnosed with migraine to determine: 1) their awareness of MOH, and 2) their knowledge of the condition and its prevention, and 3) the association of these factors with actual use of pain relief medications. We recruited and interviewed 200 English-speaking adults with migraine who had a clinic visit with a neurologist or primary care provider within the past month. Patients were identified via an electronic health record query. Almost 40% of participants had never heard of the term ‘medication-overuse headache.’ In bivariate analyses, participants who were Black or Hispanic and those with limited health literacy were less likely to have heard of MOH. Participants scored an average of 2.1 (range: 0–3) on a MOH knowledge measure; older participants, those with limited health literacy, lower education, and little or no migraine-related disability demonstrated less knowledge. Almost a third (31.5%) of patients reported overusing pain relief medication and were at risk for MOH. Overuse was not significantly associated with MOH awareness, knowledge, or sociodemographic factors, but was related to greater migraine-related disability. Our findings suggest that patient awareness and knowledge of MOH is suboptimal, particularly among older adults, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with limited health literacy. Interventions are needed to prevent MOH and better inform patients about risks associated with frequent use of pain relief medications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Context The rise in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use has been characterized by widening disparities between the least and most socially marginalized. Given access barriers, there is limited CGM patient experience information that is inclusive of those with type 2 diabetes mellitus from socially marginalized backgrounds. Objective To understand the CGM usage experience in the primary care setting across a US Medicaid population with type 2 diabetes at federally qualified health centers. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured phone interviews with 28 English- or Spanish-speaking participants prescribed the CGM who were enrolled in a US Medicaid program that subsidized CGMs. Audio recordings of interviews were transcribed and analyzed by reflective thematic analysis. Results Twenty-eight participants (75% female, median age 56 years with interquartile-range 48-60 years) were interviewed. Participants were from different racial/ethnic backgrounds: 21% non-Hispanic White, 57% Hispanic, and 18% non-Hispanic Black. Participants primarily spoke English (68%) or Spanish (32%), and 53% reported 9 or fewer years of formal education. We identified 6 major themes: initial expectations and overcoming initiation barriers, convenience and ease promote daily use, increased knowledge leads to improved self-management, collaboration with provider and clinical team, improved self-reported outcomes, and barriers and burdens are generally tolerated. Conclusion CGM use was experienced as easy to understand and viewed as a tool for diabetes self-efficacy. Expanded CGM access for socially marginalized patients with type 2 diabetes can enhance diabetes self-management to help mitigate diabetes outcome disparities.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we report a comprehensive analysis of the disparities in undergraduate degree achievements across different demographic groups in English universities. The focus is on the “degree achievement gap”, which refers to the variation in the rates of students from diverse backgrounds obtaining First- or Upper Second-Class degrees. The significance of this gap lies in its profound impact on graduates’ future opportunities, particularly in terms of access to advanced studies and professional trajectories. Recognising the critical nature of this issue, the Office for Students (OfS) has emphasised the need for higher education institutions to actively work towards bridging this gap to enhance equity and social mobility. To map how far the call for bridging this gap has been effective, our research examines trends and patterns by age, ethnicity, disability, and gender over a five-year period from 2017/2018 to 2021/2022. Methodologically, this paper employs a detailed descriptive analysis. Our findings highlight a persistent and significant gap for Black students, who are consistently less likely to achieve a First- or Upper Second-Class degree when compared to their White peers. Based on the analysis, literature review, and policy mapping exercise, we make recommendations for the implementation of targeted support, student engagement, revisiting curriculum designs, and the promotion of a more inclusive campus culture. The insights and proposed strategies will be of interest to educators and policymakers.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the national and cultural characteristics of the lexical composition of the Spanish language of Latin America. The scientific novelty of the work consists in the identification and comprehensive description of the main groups of vocabulary that make up the national and cultural originality of the vocabulary of Latin American variants of the Spanish language, and in the analysis of the features of the use of culturally labeled vocabulary in texts of various functional styles. As a result of the study, the role of lexical borrowings from the languages of Indian peoples and African immigrants in the formation of the lexical composition of the Spanish language of Latin America was revealed. The degree of influence of the American version of English on the vocabulary of Latin American national languages was determined. The main structural and semantic modifications that the vocabulary of the Spanish language endured under the influence of linguistic and cultural contacts were described. The main groups were identified culturally marked lexical units reflecting historical, socio-political, economic and cultural processes that took place in Latin American countries. Specific examples show the functioning of culturally marked vocabulary in modern Latin American speech. The study was conducted on the material of the Spanish language of Latin America.",

        "abstract": "Black queer feminist literature remains under-researched. This reflects the societal marginalisation of black queer authors in South Africa. Our article offers a comparative analysis of the representation of black queer women by black queer and cisgender authors in selected isiXhosa and English poetry. The poems selected are from Unam Wena (2021) by Mthunzikazi Mbungwana and red cotton (2018) by vangile gantsho. Firstly, we explore how queer feminism is captured from a Xhosa perspective. Secondly, we explore how English is used to expose readers to black queerness, and, thirdly, we question how literary scholarship influences or limits black queer feminist literature and the functionality of queer feminist poetry as representations of black women. Discourse theory is used to examine how authors of the selected poetry construct knowledge about black queerness from a feminist perspective and shape how people understand it. In this article we adopt a narrative enquiry within the constructionism paradigm with qualitative textual analysis. Our analysis of the poetry reveals that, although the selected poets use two different languages, the same protest voice is foregrounded, with observable differences being primarily technical—namely how form, sound, and structure are employed to set the tone and mood in the issues addressed.",

        "abstract": "Background Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating disease that can affect the entire reproductive life course of women, with potential adverse effects on pregnancy. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and endometriosis. Method Relevant articles were searched from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from inception up to December 2023. The full-text observational studies published in English that had a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis were included. The case group included pregnant women diagnosed with endometriosis at any stage, while the control group consisted of pregnant women who had not been previously diagnosed with endometriosis. Two authors extracted and analyzed the data independently. Disagreements were reconciled by reviewing the full text by a third author. Endnote X9 was used for screening and data extraction. We used fixed and random effects models in Review Manager 5.3 to analyze the pooled data. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Results Out of the 9863 articles reviewed, 23 were selected for meta-analysis. According to the results of this study, there was an association between endometriosis and gestational hypertension (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16; I2 = 45%, P < 0.00001; N = 8), pre-eclampsia (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.36; I2 = 37%, P < 0.00001; N = 12), and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.21; I2 = 8%, P = 0.0001; N = 8). Conclusions This study confirmed that endometriosis may elevate the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorders. Raising awareness of this issue will help to identify effective strategies for screening and early diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.",

        "title": "Covering Blue Voices: African American English and Authenticity in Blues Covers",
        "abstract": "Many musicologists and researchers of popular music have recently stressed the omnipresence of covers in today’s music industry. In the sociolinguistics of music, however, studio-recorded covers and their potential differences from ‘original’ compositions have certainly been acknowledged in passing, but very few sociolinguists concerned with the study of song seem to have systematically explored how language use may differ in such re-imagined musical outputs. This article reports on a study which examines the language use of 45 blues artists from three distinct time periods (viz., 1960s, 1980s, and 2010s) and three specific social groups (viz., African American; non-African American, US-based; and non-African American, non-US based) distributed over 270 studio-recorded original and cover performances. Through gradient boosting decision tree classification, it aims to analyze the artists’ use of eight phonological and lexico-grammatical features that are traditionally associated with African American English (viz., /aɪ/ monophthongization, post-consonantal word-final /t/ deletion, post-consonantal word-final /d/ deletion, alveolar nasal /n/ in  ultimas, post-vocalic word-final /r/ deletion, copula deletion, third-person singular  deletion, and not-contraction). Our analysis finds song type (i.e., the distinction between covers and originals) to have no meaningful impact on artists’ use of the examined features of African American English. Instead, our analysis reveals how performers seem to rely on these features to a great extent and do so markedly consistently, regardless of factors such as time period, socio-cultural background, or song type. This paper hence builds on our previous work on the language use of blues performers by further teasing out the complex indexical and iconic relationships between features of African American English, authenticity, and the blues genre in its various manifestations of time, place, and performance types.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the typologically unusual case of borrowed tense-mood-aspect morphemes. Data are taken from Louisiana Creole, a critically endangered French-lexifier creole. Over the course of its history, Louisiana Creole has been in contact with local varieties of both French and English, including African American English. It will be shown that points of structural congruity between Louisiana Creole and African American English have facilitated the borrowing of two aspect markers for speakers competent in both varieties. African American English stressed BIN has been borrowed and marks remote past habitual, stative, and completive. The adverb still has been borrowed and subsequently has grammaticalized as a continuative marker via spec-to-head reanalysis. These borrowings are integrated into the inflectional domain as functional heads marking aspect. Their ordering constraints are evaluated relative to a previous hierarchy proposed by Rottet. Discussion of contact-induced change in creole languages has typically been confined to examination of interactions with the lexifier, the language which contributes the majority of a creole’s vocabulary (in this case, French). Fewer studies have presented detailed accounts of how creoles behave when in contact with other languages, meaning that this particular contact context remains undertheorized.",

In order to do so, a description of the publishing market is provided to understand its importance both for the original text and for the translation in Spain. Through a textual analysis of both texts using the software Wordsmith Tools (Scott 2004), including word-frequency and concordance searches, we will explore if there is a positive or negative portrayal of Malabo. Finally, through a linguistic comparative analysis of the original and the translation, we will determine to what extent the reader in Spain can draw the same inferences as the English reader of the original.",

        "abstract": "In this June 2024 issue of the Science Education International, we are proud to present an array of scholarly articles that highlight the diverse and innovative approaches to science education from ten different countries: Türkiye, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, USA, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and China. This collection underscores the global commitment to enhancing science education through varied methodologies, cultural contexts, and unique challenges. Some of these articles were presented at the 7th ICASE World Science and Technology Education Conference, held in Dubai between March 27 and 30, 2024, further enriching the discussions with insights shared among global experts. The first article is from Türkiye. The article mentions that the rise in STEM education has led to more authors promoting Arduino in STEM. While research exists on Arduino and STEM separately, more studies on their relationship are needed. This study uses software tools (Vosviewer, Biblioshiny) and bibliometric methods, analyzing documents from Scopus (2013-2022). Performance analysis showed publication and citation trends, highlighting top contributors. Bibliographic mapping revealed conceptual, intellectual, and social structures. Results indicated prolific authors and institutes in Türkiye, with the most cited from the USA. Türkiye may soon lead due to high growth rates and younger documents. The study warns of potential monopolization and highlights the need for increased researcher mobility and collaboration. Overall, Arduino shows great promise in future STEM activities. The second article is from Greece. The article surveys primary students in Greece on their views toward STEM education based on urban or rural settings and gender. The sample included 281 students from Attica and 69 from a Greek province. Data was collected via a close-ended digital questionnaire. Most students felt good at math and science but unlikely to pursue related careers. They reported strong communication and cooperation skills. Rural students showed more confidence in improving their math and science skills, the usefulness of STEM knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. Boys showed slightly more interest in STEM careers. The study suggests further research on geographical, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in STEM education. The third article, a case study from Estonia, aimed to enhance pre-service science teachers’ readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), ICT use, and real-life applications in teacher training. It explored their perceptions of these methods and how their views evolved over time. A questionnaire was administered to 50 pre-service science teachers before and after their 2-year training, with data analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings showed that teachers studying multiple science subjects valued integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples more, with significant perception changes over time. Nearly half did not see IBL as crucial, and only a quarter recognized the importance of ICT. The fourth article is from Latvia. The article addresses that teacher competence management and development are now school responsibilities, but school leaders often lack the tools and experience. Competence management in schools can involve identifying and implementing professional development (PD) tailored to teachers' needs. Unlike the \"one size fits all\" approach, personalized PD can be more effective. This study focuses on identifying science teacher profiles to improve teaching that promotes student conceptual understanding (CU). Using a mixed-method approach, the performance of 26 urban science teachers was observed and analyzed. The study identified six distinct teacher profiles, demonstrating varied PD needs and offering a methodology for using lesson observation data to create teacher profiles in small samples. The fifth article is the second article from Greece. The study examines 12th-grade students' understanding of \"orbital\" and \"electron cloud\" concepts in quantum contexts (n=1 and n=2) through verbal and pictorial representations. It involved 192 students from six urban schools in Northern Greece using a paper-and-pencil assessment. Results show students struggle more with verbal explanations than pictorial ones and exhibit inconsistencies between these representations. They understand the electron cloud better verbally, but the orbital better pictorially. Representations for n=2 are more challenging than for n=1. Students were categorized into four classes based on their profiles, with implications for science education discussed. The sixth article is written by researchers from the Philippines and the USA. This meta-analysis study (2017-2021) assessed the impact of Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approaches on learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. Analyzing various SSI techniques, the findings revealed a strong positive influence on understanding complex environmental issues and promoting sustainable behavior. The study noted that SSI fosters critical thinking and engagement but also identified potential publication biases. It emphasized the need for context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change education. Overall, the SSI approach helps develop proactive, environmentally conscious citizens capable of addressing global issues. The seventh article is from USA. The study investigated the impact of an active project-based, aquaculture constructivist-learning program on high school students' perceptions. It aimed to determine if the program influenced students' interest, engagement, and future educational and career aspirations in STEM fields, both inside and outside the classroom. The study also sought to understand students' knowledge about aquaculture and skill development post-program participation. Qualitative data were gathered through post-student focus groups, teacher journal reflections, and public newspaper articles from three rural high schools in Kentucky. Four main themes emerged: (1) students demonstrated excitement and enthusiasm in the hands-on aquaculture program; (2) students exhibited attention to detail in aquaculture tasks, leading to increased responsibility; (3) students engaged collaboratively with their peers; and (4) there was a greater interest and confidence in STEM through practical application. The results indicated that the program engaged learners in real-world problem-solving and decision-making situations, fostering collaboration and enhancing skills such as responsibility and self-confidence in STEM. The eighth article is from Thailand. This research assessed the ability of Thai grade 10 students to construct scientific explanations and explored differences based on learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study involved 231 students from Phetchaburi province, Thailand, with 77.5% demonstrating moderate ability levels. Significant differences were found in students' ability levels based on their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. The study also revealed correlations between students' ability levels and their learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size. Students with higher learning achievement, positive attitudes, and attendance at larger schools tended to have higher ability levels. However, there was no significant relationship between students' attitudes toward science and school size. These findings emphasize the importance of considering individual differences and backgrounds, particularly in terms of learning achievement, attitude toward science, and school size, when teaching science. The ninth article is from United Arab Emirates (UAE). This mixed-approach study explores the effects of virtual science laboratories on students' motivation and attitude toward science. Conducted in an American curriculum private school in Dubai, the research surveyed 237 students from grades 7 to 11. Results show that virtual laboratories positively impact students' overall motivation, including intrinsic motivation, perceived usefulness, effort, perceived self-efficacy, and attitude toward science. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived usefulness significantly influence students' attitudes toward science, with perceived self-efficacy being a predictor of their effort. The tenth article is from South Africa. This study examines the effectiveness of Khan Academy Videos (KAVs) in rural thermodynamics education. 88 students were divided into two groups: one taught traditionally (control group [CG]) and the other using KAVs (experimental group [EG]). Results show significant improvement in learning outcomes and engagement with KAVs, with EG scores increasing by 61% compared to 31% in the CG. Pre-tests and post-tests were used to measure academic performance, and a mixed-method approach analyzed results and feedback. The study highlights the positive impact of KAV integration on student performance, especially in resource-limited rural schools, suggesting its transformative potential in enhancing teaching quality. The eleventh article is from China. The article analyzes 30 documents from Web of Science and CNKI databases to compare and understand the role of science teachers in China and overseas. The research highlights slow development in both Chinese and English publications, with most studies in theoretical exploration. The role of science teachers encompasses five main aspects: Role expectation, role orientation, role identification, role transformation, and role enactment. Combining the \"should be\" research from Chinese publications with the \"real\" research from English publications could lead to a more comprehensive understanding and positive interaction. This analysis provides a basis for future research on the role of science teachers. As a final remark, the Science Education In",

        "abstract": "Background: Audiovisual distraction is a potentially good technique to reduce medical treatment procedure-related fear and anxiety among children. However, few studies have assessed its effectiveness. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis for evaluating the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction in reducing pain anxiety in pediatrics. Methods: Randomized control trials and experimental studies that reported the use of audiovisual distraction during medical/dental treatments among children aged 3–8 years, used the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale to assess pain, and were published between 2005–2021 and in English were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used for evidence analysis. Results: A total of four studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis: two were from South Asia and one each were from Africa and North America. Three of these studies were randomized control trials. The variability among the studies was high. Three of the four studies found that AV techniques were significantly effective in reducing pain during procedures compared with the control group (P < 0.00001), while one study found no difference; the cumulative evidence in the forest plot was similar. Conclusion: Cumulative evidence suggests that the use of audiovisual distraction is an effective strategy in reducing medical/dental procedures-related pain anxiety among children aged 3–8 years. However, evidence on this is currently limited, and thus further studies are required using various AD techniques and on different populations to substantiate these findings. Funding: None.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nSome blood operators routinely screen blood donations for high-titre (HT) anti-A/B to reduce the risk of a haemolytic transfusion reaction due to out-of-group plasma-rich components. We assessed donor factors associated with an increased likelihood of screening positive and compared routine data between England and Australia.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData were assessed from HT screening during 2018-2020 in Australia and 2018-2021 in England, totalling nearly 6 million blood donations. Screening was performed using a Beckman Coulter PK7300 analyser with a micro-titre plate saline direct agglutination test in both countries, although different reagent red cells were chosen. HT-positive was defined as testing positive at a titre of 128 or above.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe likelihood of a donor testing HT-positive was greater for females than males, declined with age and was dependent on the ABO group. However, the proportion of donors testing HT-positive was consistently higher in Australia than in England: overall, 14% of group O donations and 5% of group A donations in England tested HT-positive, compared with 51% and 22%, respectively in Australia. English data also showed that donors from Black, Asian or mixed ethnic backgrounds were more likely to test HT-positive than White donors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data demonstrate that donor sex, age, ABO group and ethnicity affect the likelihood of testing HT-positive. Differences in testing methods likely had a significant impact on the proportion of donors testing as HT-positive or -negative rather than any differences in donor populations.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Tobacco consumption and its impact on health remain high worldwide. Additionally, it is a contentious issue generating significant controversy. Twitter has proven to be a useful platform for evaluating public health topics related to population health behaviors, and tobacco consumption. Objective The objective of this study is to analyze the content of tweets related to tobacco. Moreover, geolocation data will be considered to understand regional differences. Methods Tweets published between 2018 and 2022, in both English and Spanish, containing the keyword “tobacco,” were analyzed. A total of 56,926 tweets were obtained. The tweets were classified into different categories. 550 tweets were manually analyzed, and an automated and computerized classification was performed for the remaining and largest subset of tweets. Results The analysis yielded 30,812 classifiable tweets. Healthcare professionals were the most frequent contributors to the topic (50.2%), with the most common theme being general information about the toxic effects of tobacco. 57.9% of the tweets discussed the harmful effects of tobacco on health, with fear being the predominant emotion. The largest number of tweets were located in America. Conclusions Our study revealed a substantial number of tweets highlighting the health risks and negative perceptions of tobacco consumption. Africa showed the lowest percentage of tweets discussing the health risks associated with tobacco, coinciding with the continent having the least developed anti-tobacco policies. Healthcare professionals emerged as the most prominent users discussing the topic, which is encouraging as they play a crucial role in disseminating accurate and scientific health information.",

A deep understanding of the Arab community’s perspective on cervical cancer screening is needed to address the disparity in rates across populations in Michigan. Arab and Chaldean women across Michigan were invited to participate in Zoom-based focus groups to understand the attitudes, acceptability, and barriers of cervical cancer screening among this population. Four focus groups with a total of 19 women aged 30 to 61 were conducted. The focus groups were conducted in English, Arabic, or both languages. The guided discussion was focused on knowledge of cervical cancer and Human papillomavirus (HPV) and its transmission, attitudes towards HPV vaccination, and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening. HPV self-sampling as an alternative to traditional provider-based screening was specifically discussed as this has been proposed as a way to increase screening in hard-to-reach populations. The conversations revealed insights related to barriers at the individual and community levels for screening and vaccination, attitudes towards preventive health care including screening, a need for accessible women’s health literature, and health education. The women also discussed vaccine hesitancy related to HPV and COVID-19, suggesting a need for targeted community interventions.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of sociolinguistic research, African American Language (AAL) remains stigmatized throughout the United States education system. There have been proposals to counteract this through curricula and/or ideological interventions targeted at teachers that seek to validate AAL while maintaining Dominant American English (DAE) as an educational target. However, such approaches have been criticized for giving limited attention to combating the racism that underlies much linguistic marginalization. We used a mixed‐methods approach to explore the benefits and limitations of a dialect‐shifting curriculum in shaping teachers' language ideologies. Participants (n = 40) were K‐1 teachers in a predominantly Black mid‐Atlantic city. They were participating in an efficacy study of a dialect‐shifting curriculum; schools were randomly assigned to teach the curriculum (intervention condition) or continue with business as usual. Before and after the intervention, teachers completed a survey of their language attitudes, and a subset (n = 16) participated in semi‐structured interviews. On the survey, teachers displayed more favorable attitudes toward language variation at the end of the school year, regardless of condition. The interviews revealed a range of perspectives, revealing a tension between a belief in the utility of DAE for their students and an understanding that many students will wish to use AAL in their communities. The curriculum provided shared vocabulary to discuss this tension and increased some teachers' acceptance of AAL in non‐academic settings, but many did not view dialect variation as relevant to their priorities as K‐1 teachers. These findings clarify the trade‐offs involved in work toward a more (linguistically) inclusive education system.",

        "title": "EFFECT OF BILINGUAL INSTRUCTIONAL METHOD IN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF JUNIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN MATHEMATICS",
        "abstract": "The importance of mathematics in the modern society is overwhelming. The importance of mathematics has long been recognized all over the world, and that is why all students are required to study mathematics at the primary and secondary school levels, whether they have the aptitude for it or not (Ojo, 2015; Adebayo, 2008; Adeleke, 2007). However, despite the importance of mathematics in the Nigerian education system, the students’ performances continue to deteriorate year after year. Several reasons have been proffered for the high failure rate in mathematics. Given the options, many students will not offer mathematics (Agwagah, 2013). Agwagah noted that an increasing number of students find it difficult to do well in mathematics because of the teaching method used in teaching most of the themes are not interesting. In other words, the prime position accorded mathematics in the society is at risk because of persistent poor performance. According to Kurumeh and Achor (2008), the difficulties of students in learning mathematics could be attributed to the approach to which the contents are being presented to the students, the abstractness of mathematical concepts, and poor foundation, among others. Most students, especially, at the Junior Secondary School (JSS) have difficulties in understanding mathematics because of the language of instruction (which is English Language) (Ifeanacho, 2012). Majority of the students who are highly proficient in performing mathematical operations, in solving symbolic problems are less proficient in solving problems when it is algebraic (Iji, Abakpa, & Takor, 2015).In recent years, the language of instruction has become an active focus of investigation in education research, including research in mathematics education. Such focus is a symptom of a relatively recent paradigmatic shift whose main characteristics are a new understanding of the student and increasing awareness of the learning contexts, such as, notably the complexities arising from cultural and linguistic diversity (Radford & Barwell, 2022). When students’ conceptualizations are perceived to be incorrect, language is often then seen as an obstacle or barrier to the effective communication of the desired knowledge or structures. Language, however, is clearly more than a hindrance or an obstacle; language, talk, text and the production and interpretation of symbols are integral to the creation of learning, teaching and assessment, particularly in mathematics. The contributions of language, the politics of discourse, and critical studies, with most emphasis on the issue of multilingual classrooms need the urgent attention of education stakeholders. Multilingualism is the ability to speak two or more languages fluently. There are many benefits of multilingualism, such as improving cognitive, social, emotional, and economic skills. Multilingualism does not seem to have a significant impact on mathematical reasoning or problem-solving. However, multilingual students who are allowed to use many languages to discuss and solve problems have increased mathematical productivity, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Teachers working in a multilingual setting should be aware that the use of the first language may have a great influence on mathematics learning, especially when the students are involved in cognitively complex issues. The study of multilingual mathematics learners requires theoretical notions that address not only the cognitive and domain-specific aspects of learning mathematics but also the linguistic and cross-cultural nature of this work.Multilingualism has multiple benefits for students, such as giving them an academic advantage and improving their employment prospects once they leave school. Moreover, multilingualism gives them access to more than one culture and improves their understanding of different cultures and languages (Halai & Clarkson, 2016). Language plays a crucial role in learning amidst a multilingual classroom (Adetuyi, 2017). Essien (2018) opined that learning of mathematics is through language, and involves reading, writing, listening and discussion, all of which are heavily language-based activities. Natural language and language of mathematics play different roles. With their own specificities, each of them provides individuals with access to different layers of mathematical consciousness. They provide individuals with different forms of expressiveness and aesthetic experience. Several studies (e.g. Atweh, Bose, Graven, Subramanian & Venkat, 2014) noted the concerns about primary school students’ poor achievement in numeracy across many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Essien (2018) observed that various mathematics education research on multilingualism point to the intricate link between language competence and mathematics classroom practices. However, systematic review of literature on multilingualism (e.g. Setati, Chitera & Essien, 2009; Essien, 2018) found insignificant number of publications that focused on multilingual classroom practices and students’ achievement. In addition, research on the role of language in multilingual primary school level was insignificant compared to the role of language in mathematics at other levels of education. While literature has focused on pedagogical practices, role of language and conceptual framework necessary to support teaching and learning in a multilingual classroom ( e.g. Freeman & Freeman, 2014; Viesca & Teemant, 2019). Van Laren and Goba (2013) suggested that when teaching mathematics to second language students, teachers should introduce two languages simultaneously for clarity of the mathematical terms and concepts for good academic achievement. Kasma Suwanarak (2014) opined that balanced-language instruction to some extent promote academic achievement in bilingual students. Hence, the more bilingual experience and the more balanced exposure to both of their languages the students have, the more advantages they gain for promoting their learning success.The importance of language in the teaching and learning of mathematics can never be over emphasized. Teaching mathematics with two languages most especially with the local language can increase the rate of comprehension by the students. Different ways of understanding learning contribute to our knowledge of the relationship between language and mathematics in bilingual classrooms. According to Moschkovich, (2007) the relationship between language and mathematics in research began in the field of psychology and examined the cognitive functioning of bilingual learners during arithmetic computations and the solving of word problems.Achievement is the result, the successfulness, the extent or ability, the progress in learning educational experiences that the individual indicate in relation with his/her educational learning (Olga, 2008). Achievement in mathematics, which is the focus of this study, is viewed as a very important factor in teaching and learning of mathematics and it refers to students’ cognitive achievement and psychomotor skills, which are measured in terms of pass or fail (Adebayo, 2008; Popoola & Ajani, 2011). When achievement is below expectation, it is referred to as under-achievement or poor achievement.

        "title": "Determinants of effective interventions for HIV prevention, treatment, and care to address inequitable HIV outcomes among Black Women of African Descent (BWAD) in High-Income Countries: Systematic review protocol",
        "abstract": "Background In High-Income Countries (HICs) HIV/AIDS continues to disproportionally affect Black Women of African Descent (BWAD) and other racialized groups and is now a major public health concern. Despite the multiple efforts, evidence is limited on the effectiveness of HIV interventions to address the HIV outcomes inequalities among BWAD. This protocol outlines the methodological process of a systematic review that will gather quantitative and qualitative data to examine existing determinants of effective HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions to address the HIV outcomes disparities and inequities among BWAD in HICs. Methods A systematic review of eligible articles will be conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature will be made in MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO Host), and Global Health (Ovid). Peer-reviewed studies involving the experience of BWAD in HICs; different HIV prevention, treatment, and care interventions both in the community and in a clinical setting; studies that report on the experience of BWAD on HIV intervention/ service including different levels of barriers and facilitators; reports of original research and peer-reviewed articles based on qualitative, quantitative, and mixed study designs published in English from 1980 onwards in HICs will be included. A narrative synthesis, thematic synthesis, and descriptive quantitative analysis of both extracted qualitative and quantitative data will be undertaken. Conclusion Substantial changes including tailored interventions are needed to address the inequities in HIV outcomes that disproportionally impact BWAD in HICs. Understanding the determinants of the effectiveness of BWAD-focused HIV interventions is critical to stemming the HIV epidemic and reducing the burden of the disease and poor health outcomes experienced by BWAD in HICs Our study finding will inform the multi level and multisectoral stakeholder including public health, community-based organizations and nongovernmental civil society organization engaged in BWAD HIV and health policy and practice in HICs. Findings from this review will be used to guide effective response to HIV/AIDS using an equity-driven policy and practice framework. Trial registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023458938.",

        "abstract": "Background In the United Kingdom, pregnant women who live in the most deprived areas have two times the risk of dying than those who live in the least deprived areas. There are even greater disparities between women from different ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of area-based deprivation and ethnicity in the increased risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM), in primiparous women in England. Methods A retrospective nationwide population study was conducted using English National Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database. All primiparous women were included if they gave birth in an National Healthcare Service (NHS) hospital in England between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2021. Logistic regression was used to examine the relative odds of SMM by Index of Multiple Deprivation and ethnicity, adjusting for age and health behaviours, medical and psychological factors. Results The study population comprised 1 178 756 primiparous women. Neighbourhood deprivation increased the risk of SMM at the time of childbirth. In the fully adjusted model, there was a linear trend (p=0.001) between deprivation quintile and the odds of SMM. Being from a minoritised ethnic group also independently increased the risk of SMM, with black or black British African women having the highest risk, adjusted OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.70 to 2.00) compared with white women. There was no interaction between deprivation and ethnicity (p=0.49). Conclusion This study has highlighted that neighbourhood deprivation and ethnicity are important, independently associated risk factors for SMM.",

        "abstract": "Background Injuries are among the leading causes for hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. COVID-19 restrictions ensured safety to Canadians, but also negatively impacted health outcomes, including increasing rates of certain injuries. These differences in trends have been reported internationally however the evidence is scattered and needs to be better understood to identify opportunities for public education and to prepare for future outbreaks. Objective A scoping review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on unintentional injuries in Canada, compared to other countries. Methods Studies investigating unintentional injuries among all ages during COVID-19 from any country, published in English between December 2019 and July 2021, were included. Intentional injuries and/or previous pandemics were excluded. Four databases were searched (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus), and a gray literature search was also conducted. Results The search yielded 3,041 results, and 189 articles were selected for extraction. A total of 41 reports were included from the gray literature search. Final studies included research from: Europe (n = 85); North America (n = 44); Asia (n = 32); Oceania (n = 12); Africa (n = 8); South America (n = 4); and multi-country (n = 4). Most studies reported higher occurrence of injuries/trauma among males, and the average age across studies was 46 years. The following mechanisms of injury were reported on most frequently: motor vehicle collisions (MVCs; n = 134), falls (n = 104), sports/recreation (n = 65), non-motorized vehicle (n = 31), and occupational (n = 24). Injuries occurring at home (e.g., gardening, home improvement projects) increased, and injuries occurring at schools, workplaces, and public spaces decreased. Overall, decreases were observed in occupational injuries and those resulting from sport/recreation, pedestrian-related, and crush/trap incidents. Decreases were also seen in MVCs and burns, however the severity of injury from these causes increased during the pandemic period. Increases were observed in poisonings, non-motorized vehicle collisions, lacerations, drownings, trampoline injuries; and, foreign body ingestions. Implications Findings from this review can inform interventions and policies to identify gaps in public education, promote safety within the home, and decrease the negative impact of future stay-at-home measures on unintentional injury among Canadians and populations worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Malaria has inflicted serious morbidity and mortality across the globe. The major brunt of the disease has been on African, South-East Asian and South American countries. Proportionally, malaria has attracted global research priorities and this is evident from the number of publications related to malaria from across the globe, irrespective of its endemicity. However, formal and exhaustive analyses of these ‘malaria publications’ are rarely reported. The systematic review and secondary data analyses were done to retrieve information on what has been published on malaria, where is it published, and which countries are major contributors to malaria research. The study presents malaria publications from 1945 to 2020 retrieved using three databases: Web of Science^™, Embase^® and Scopus^®. Exported data were examined to determine the number of publications over time, their subject areas, contributions from various countries/organizations, and top publishing journals. The total number of published records on malaria ranged from 90,282 to 112,698 (due to three different databases). Based on the number of publications, USA, UK, France, and India were identified as the top four countries. Malaria Journal, American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, and PLoS One were the most preferred journals, whereas the University of London (Institutions other than LSHTM), the National Institute of Health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Oxford appeared to be the top contributing organization. A disproportional contribution to malaria research was observed with non-malaria endemic countries making the largest contribution. Databases differed in their output format and needed standardization to make the outputs comparable across databases.",

        "title": "Defining the Black population in Canadian health research: a scoping review protocol",
        "abstract": "Introduction In the context of health research in Canada, various terms and labels have been employed to reference the Black population. This practice has had the unintended consequence of diminishing the comparability and efficiency of studies. Furthermore, using a broad term such as ‘Black’ may fail to encompass the diversity and intricacy of the ethnocultural backgrounds of people who are racialised as such. It may also obscure the subtleties of their experiences and health outcomes. This study aims to examine how health researchers have defined Black within the scope of their work and different labels used to identify the Black population in Canada. Methods and analysis We have developed and employed a comprehensive and sensitive search strategy to identify articles concerning the health and wellness of the Black population in Canada. Both peer-reviewed and grey literature will be searched. Original articles published in both English and French will be included. The screening process will consist of two stages: the title and abstract screening, followed by a thorough examination of full-text articles. Additionally, single citation tracking and manual search of reference lists will be conducted. Study characteristics and relevant information on the definition of the Black population will be extracted, followed by reflective thematic analysis and presentation of the key findings. Ethics and dissemination This review will not require ethical approval. We will disseminate the results through meetings with stakeholders. From the beginning, a knowledge translation approach was decided upon following consultation with citizen researchers and community champions. Our findings will also be disseminated through oral and poster presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media.",

        "title": "Otherization and Identity Distortion in Dangarembga’s Writing",
        "abstract": "In spite of the fact that most African novelists, penning stories in English language by the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, were graduates of the British colonial missionaries and universities, they had yet been able to escape the suppressive ideology of colonization and become genuine mouthpieces for their native communities’ struggles and adversity. Amongst whom, the Zimbabwean Tsitsi Dangarembga rose to the fore as representative of her fellow countrywomen during the British colonization. Henceforth, concomitant with the rise of postcolonial criticism in the literary arena, this paper aims to address the European colonial mechanism of otherization and its impact on the identity construction of the otherized subject in Dangarembga’s novels, Nervous Conditions and The Book of Not. Dangarembga foreshadows the main thematic realm of her semi-autobiographical trilogy, through her first novel’s title which is reminiscent of Frantz Fanon’s preface in the book of The Wretched of the Earth. To unravel the intricate complexities of the colonizer/colonized contact, this study pinpoints the psychological confusion of the protagonist, Tambuzdai, as an exemplar of the colonized Black individual’s distress. To fathom the depth of Tambu’s psyche during those encounters, this paper relies on Elke Boehmer’s attribution of otherization as a Western self-projecting process that seeks to produce self-soothing and “dark mirror-images” of the other. In addition, Du Bois’s analysis of double consciousness seems to account for the protagonist’s identity crisis and self alienation. In conclusion, Dangarembga does not seem as an opponent of cultural exchanges in general or hybridity in particular, but she simply advocates cautious adaption that does not decentre and disregard one’s native-ness and cultural origins.",

        "abstract": "The main goal of this work is to reposition the concept of xenophobia in the African context. This is to reflect on Thabo Mbeki’s narrative on Xenophobia. Africa continues to remain a pawn due to the Eurocentric ideas that have been forced on the Africans also brought about a foreign concept of xenophobia as if Africans are not brothers in the name of brotherhood. It is incontestable that brothers are, in some cases engage in fight, but there was a laid down rules and norms of resolving such misunderstanding. With the employment of qualitative research methods, complex interdependence theory garnished with Anglo-American conspiracy theory; we argue that, Anglo-American imperialist managed to spread and enforce the usage of English through imposing the concept xenophobia in the continent while failing to capture the essence of sibling fights or fights amongst African brothers and sisters conceptualised by the Batswana speaking people as maragana teng a bana motho. Through acknowledging Mbeki’s narrative and some sampled African languages, we argue that, while there is a word for foreigner in these sampled African languages, there is no direct or indirect translation of xenophobia in African languages. We conclude that the concept xenophobia has its etymological foundations in Greek and is therefore foreign in any of the African and South African indigenous languages.",

        "abstract": "Teaching methods can help learners to develop problem-solving skills and enhance their achievement in stoichiometry. Process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) is one of the teaching methods that promote problem-solving skills because it provides opportunities for learners to work with many formulae through many steps in solving problems such as stoichiometric calculations of number of moles and concentration of solutions. To understand how POGIL can improve learners’ achievement and develop problem-solving skills, four grade 11 physical sciences classes of mixed gender and multicultural black learners were purposefully and conventional sampled from four different township schools in Pretoria, South Africa. Through pre- and post-test case study and lesson observations, two different independent groups (POGIL group and lecture group) were included in the study. POGIL group constituted 48 students, while lecture group 62 students taught by their respective teachers at their schools for three weeks using English second language. The results from the pre-test suggest that learners in all the four classes lacked problem-solving competencies in solving both the low-order and the high-order stoichiometry questions. According to the research interpretation, lesson observations of POGIL were active learning while lecture method was passive learning. The post-test results indicate statistically significant greater problem-solving competencies in POGIL group than in the lecture group. The study recommends the use of POGIL in teaching stoichiometry.",

        "abstract": "Aims A large body of evidence suggests that experiences of, and access to mental healthcare in England varies according to ethnicity. Inequitable use of restrictive interventions is of particular concern, including within perinatal services: a national-level study of inpatients on Mother and Baby Units (MBU) in 2017 found that 28% of white patients were detained under the mental health act (MHA), compared with 61.5% of Black African, and 66 – 77% of Asian mothers. We carried out an audit with the aim of examining detention rates, length of stay, and time to first section 17 leave on an MBU in South Manchester according to ethnicity and English language ability, to compare with national averages. Methods We identified all patients discharged from Andersen Ward (an MBU) between March 2022 and March 2023. Using electronic medical records we extracted information on: ethnicity, language spoken (English vs other), mental health act status (detained under Section 2/3 vs informal), duration of admission, date of detention, date of first Section 17 leave. We calculated the percentage of patients who were detained according to ethnicity (White British, Mixed/other, Asian, Black), and the odds of detention according to ethnicity. Statistical significance was assessed using chi-squared testing. We also compared average length of stay and time to first section 17 leave by ethnicity. Results 74 patients had been discharged from the MBU within the audit period. 88% of Black inpatients were admitted under the Mental Health act, compared with 72.7% of Asian mothers, 33.3% of Mixed ethnicity or other ethnicities and 28.3% of white mothers. Differences in detention rates according to ethnicity were statistically significant. Of 11 mothers documented as having a language other than English as their primary language, all had been detained. Length of admission and days to first section 17 leave were not significantly different between ethnicities. Conclusion Many factors may contribute to the observed higher detention rates among non-White patients: language barriers and a lack of intercultural competence could lead to risk-averse decision-making during MHA assessments, and different help-seeking patterns might mean White mothers seek help earlier, or for less severe mental health problems. Recommendations include expanding access to high-quality interpreters; investigating factors underlying MHA decision-making through qualitative research; and improving cultural competence among section 12 approved clinicians by incorporating feedback from ethnic minority patients into training and refresher courses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Despite the high prevalence of headaches in pediatric patients with brain tumors, very little research has been done to characterize their traits and to assess current management practices. Effective and efficient treatment of these headaches is critical to the optimization of brain tumor survivors’ quality of life. Foundational knowledge of any clinical associations likely would be beneficial to develop rational management strategies. METHODS A retrospective single-institution chart review of pediatric patients seen in the Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO) Neuro-oncology clinic from 1/1/22-12/31/22 is underway. Information is being collected via manual chart review including basic demographic information, oncologic diagnosis and tumor location, surgical interventions, and tumor-directed treatments. Headache characteristics, including timing of onset, associated symptoms, severity and frequency, referral to CHCO Neurology Headache Clinic and any headache therapies attempted will be sought. Additional information will include the number of emergency department visits and unplanned MRIs obtained as part of headache management. RESULTS 384 patients (53% male; median age 12 years, range 2-24 years) received care in the CHCO Neuro-oncology clinic in 2022. The majority of these patients were Caucasian/Non-Hispanic (61.7%), followed by Caucasian/Hispanic (13.8%) and African American/Non-Hispanic (4.2%). In this cohort, the preferred language for 93% was English and for 6% was Spanish. The majority (55%) of patients had a low-grade glioma/ glioneuronal tumor as their oncologic diagnosis. Patients with referrals to CHCO Headache clinic made up 13% of this cohort. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS This data set will help to characterize the prevalence and features of headaches in pediatric patients with CNS tumors. This information will serve as the foundation for planned prospective studies that will collect more comprehensive and consistent data related to headaches in the pediatric neuro-oncology population and to formalize processes that will identify appropriate patients for referral to specialized headache providers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates how and whether speakers of endangered languages employ variation as a stylistic resource to make social meaning and index their identities. The study is set in historically Creole-speaking communities in rural Louisiana, which have now shifted almost completely to English. The Americanization of Louisiana induced language shift, but also a shift to the Anglo-American racial binary which supplanted local constructs of ethnicity and race. The study crafts a historical-sociolinguistic account of this process of Americanization, examining how linguistic differentiation was enacted through the enregisterment of iconic ‘Creole’/‘French’ variants as indexical links to the ‘Black’/‘White’ racial binary. Today, to a very limited extent, some speakers of Louisiana Creole still consider some variants socially meaningful and employ them to stylistic ends. This depends especially on racial identity and the variant in question. Subject pronouns retain some indexical value, occasionally employed stylistically by speakers racialized as White. However, front vowel rounding has fossilized: highly meaningful in the early-20th century, its social meaning has been lost resulting in synchronic personal-pattern variation. The paper ends by trying to reconcile classic studies of Language Death with contemporary variationist critique, answering recent calls for more nuanced approaches to sociolinguistic variation in threatened languages.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines depends on widespread vaccine uptake. Employing a telephone-administered weighted survey with 19,502 participants, we examined the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among adults in Texas. We used multiple regression analysis with LASSO-selected variables to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and intentions to receive the vaccine among the unvaccinated. The prevalence of unvaccinated individuals (22%) was higher among those aged 18–39, males, White respondents, English speakers, uninsured individuals, those facing financial challenges, and individuals expressing no concern about contracting the illness. In a fully adjusted regression model, higher odds of being unvaccinated were observed among males (aOR 1.11), the uninsured (aOR 1.38), smokers (aOR 1.56), and those facing financial struggles (aOR 1.62). Conversely, Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics were less likely to be unvaccinated compared to Whites. Among the unvaccinated, factors associated with stronger intent to receive the vaccine included age (over 65 years), Black and Hispanic ethnicity, and perceived risk of infection. Hispanic individuals, the uninsured, those covered by public insurance, and those facing financial challenges were more likely to encounter barriers to vaccine receipt. These findings underscore the importance of devising tailored strategies, emphasizing nuanced approaches that account for demographic, socioeconomic, and attitudinal factors in vaccine distribution and public health interventions.",

        "abstract": "This research was a study of language code mixing contained in the lyrics of a song titled “You Never Know” by Blackpink. This study aimed to identify the forms of code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song you never know by black pink, identify the types of code mixing used in the song lyrics, and describe the source language of the code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song. The method used in this study was content analysis, which was a qualitatively oriented technique, usually used to determine the character of documents or to compare them. The conclusion obtained from this study was the forms of code mixing contained in the lyrics of the song You Never Know by Blackpink consisting of inserting words, phrases and clauses. Code mixing in the form of words totaling 8 data, phrases totaling 20 data and clauses totaling 10 data. The type of code mixing used in the lyrics of the song you never know by Blackpink was alternation code mixing. The outer code mixing used was 8 data. The source language contained in the lyrics of the song You Never Know by Blackpink came from English and Korean. The code-mixed from English language was 26 data and Korean was 44 data. Through this research, it can be suggested that further researchers can be developed with the theory of code switching which is closely related to code switching.",

        "title": "Identifying social determinants of health in populations exposed to structural inequities: a qualitative study of the COVID-19 pandemic experiences of Black and Latinx people living with HIV and cardiovascular risks",
        "abstract": "Introduction Black and Latinx communities experience inequities in the social determinants of health (SDOH) and high rates of chronic illnesses [e.g., cardiovascular disease (CVD), HIV]. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified these long-standing SDOH disparities. However, scant attention has been paid to the pandemic-related experiences of populations exposed to structural inequities. Methods Using a semi-structured interview guide, 60 in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with Black and Latinx people living with HIV (PLWH) and CVD risks to assess: (1) perceived personal and community risk for COVID-19; (2) knowledge of and access to COVID-19 public health information; (3) barriers to COVID-19 public health recommendations and vaccine uptake; and (4) perceptions of HIV, CVD, and COVID-19. Interviews were professionally transcribed into either English or Spanish. Spanish transcripts were translated into English. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to summarize each transcript into a structured templaicte corresponding to interview guide domains. Summaries were combined into matrices for identification and comparison of themes across domains. Results Participants reported risks for COVID-19 due to being immunocompromised and SDOH, including transportation, exposure to risks conferred by others, living in under-resourced neighborhoods, and housing insecurity. Participants engaged in protective countermeasures by adhering to public health mandates. Relationships with providers, participating in community support groups, and digital inclusion and literacy were salient with respect to dissemination of COVID-19 information and vaccine uptake. Experiences with managing a chronic illness facilitated vaccine acceptance. Participants described language barriers, experiences of discrimination, and a historical lack of trust in medical systems and vaccines. Discussion This study provides a real-time narrative from PLWH and CVD risks who were vulnerable during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications include the need for continuity with providers and established community networks, increasing internet access and digital health literacy, and addressing historical trauma incurred in medical settings. It is critical to understand the impact of traditional SDOH on those living with chronic illness as well as other social determinants that shed light on access to public health information, adherence to public health recommendations, and vaccine uptake among populations exposed to structural inequities.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by disparities in disease burden and medical care provision. Whether these disparities extend to long COVID awareness and receipt of medical care is unknown. We aimed to characterize awareness of long COVID and receipt of medical care for long COVID symptoms among populations who experience disparities in the United States (US). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a national sample of US adults between January 26–February 5, 2023. We surveyed approximately 2,800 adults drawn from the Ipsos probability-based KnowledgePanel® who identify as White, Black, or Hispanic, with over-sampling of Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-proficient adults. Awareness of long COVID was assessed with the question, “Have you heard of long COVID? This is also referred to as post-COVID, Long-haul COVID, Post-acute COVID-19, or Chronic COVID.” Respondents reporting COVID-19 symptoms lasting longer than 1 month were classified as having long COVID and asked about receipt of medical care. Results Of the 2,828 respondents, the mean age was 50.4 years, 52.8% were female, 40.2% identified as Hispanic, 29.8% as Black, and 26.7% as White. 18% completed the survey in Spanish. Overall, 62.5% had heard of long COVID. On multivariate analysis, long COVID awareness was lower among respondents who identified as Black (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51, 0.81), Hispanic and completed the survey in English (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46, 0.76), and Hispanic and completed the survey in Spanish (OR 0.31, 95% C.I. 0.23, 0.41), compared to White respondents (overall p < 0.001). Long COVID awareness was also associated with educational attainment, higher income, having health insurance, prior history of COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination. Among those reporting symptoms consistent with long COVID (n = 272), 26.8% received medical care. Older age, longer symptom duration and greater symptom impact were associated with receipt of medical care for long COVID symptoms. Of those who received care, most (77.8%) rated it as less than excellent on a 5-point scale. Discussion This survey reveals limited awareness of long COVID and marked disparities in awareness according to race, ethnicity, and language. Targeted public health campaigns are needed to raise awareness.",

        "abstract": "Background Ovarian cancer is a challenging disease to diagnose and treat effectively with five-year survival rates below 50%. Previous patient experience research in high-income countries highlighted common challenges and opportunities to improve survival and quality of life for women affected by ovarian cancer. However, no comparable data exist for low-and middle-income countries, where 70% of women with the disease live. This study aims to address this evidence gap. Methods This is an observational multi-country study set in low- and middle-income countries. We aim to recruit over 2000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer across multiple hospitals in 24 countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Country sample sizes have been calculated (n = 70–96 participants /country), taking account of varying national five-year disease prevalence rates. Women within five years of their diagnosis, who are in contact with participating hospitals, are invited to take part in the study. A questionnaire has been adapted from a tool previously used in high-income countries. It comprises 57 multiple choice and two open-ended questions designed to collect information on demographics, women’s knowledge of ovarian cancer, route to diagnosis, access to treatments, surgery and genetic testing, support needs, the impact of the disease on women and their families, and their priorities for action. The questionnaire has been designed in English, translated into local languages and tested according to local ethics requirements. Questionnaires will be administered by a trained member of the clinical team. Conclusion This study will inform further research, advocacy, and action in low- and middle-income countries based on tailored approaches to the national, regional and global challenges and opportunities. In addition, participating countries can choose to repeat the study to track progress and the protocol can be adapted for other countries and other diseases.",

        "abstract": "The responses of labour markets to global pandemics are attracting renewed interest, although the English labour laws in response to the Black Death of 1348/9 – capping wages, imposing annual contracts, and restricting mobility – have a long and established scholarship. The conventional wisdom is that the legislation represented an extension of existing local practices and created common cause among all categories of employer. Yet this view is hard to reconcile with the fact that, despite subsequent revisions, the legislation soon failed. These arguments are tested through original research into how the legislation was actually enforced in a variety of legal tribunals (manorial, borough, and royal). A clear distinction is maintained between public presentments and private litigation, and a robust methodology is pursued to record their absence as well as quantifying their presence. This casts new light on the novelty of the labour laws, the reasons for their failure, and their influence on contract law. The analysis exemplifies the potential for short‐term legal responses to infectious diseases to have unintended and unanticipated long‐term consequences.",

        "abstract": "The black-veined white butterfly, Aporia crataegi, reached the north-western edge of its European geographic distribution in the British Isles in the 19th century, but became extinct in the early 20th century, following several cold decades. Substantial areas of potential breeding habitat in southern Britain are currently available to this species, which requires scattered hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and suckering blackthorn scrub (Prunus spinosa), including infrequently cut hedgerows. These habitats are needed at a relatively large scale as the butterfly occurs as networks of colonies (metapopulations), ranging over large tracts of connected landscape. A number of events have increased habitat availability over the past 70 years (myxomatosis reduced rabbit populations, which permitted host plant scrub regeneration; hedgerow management policies reduced cutting frequencies; rewilding and landscape connectivity initiatives are resulting in additional scrub). However, while A. crataegi males occasionally disperse several kilometres, it is unlikely that A. crataegi females will cross the English Channel in sufficient numbers to establish populations in southern England, without assistance. Here, we (i) provide a review of the literature on species interactions, the habitat requirements, distribution and dispersal of A. crataegi and (ii) provide evidence that southern, eastern and central England are likely to be climatically suitable for reintroductions of A. crataegi. Substantial areas of England are already expected to be amongst the climatically most suitable parts of Europe for this insect. We identify a landscape of at least 100 km2 containing multiple patches of suitable habitats, and highlight co-benefits for other species that inhabit scrubland and successional mosaics. We use a climate-matching approach to assess climatically-similar locations to obtain source material most likely to establish in Britain. Areas of northern France and mid elevations in the Iberian Peninsula, including in the Pyrenees, provide potential suitable source locations due to close climatic matching and a large number of species records. We recommend reestablishment from more than one source, providing genetic diversity in the reintroduced population, enabling subsequent local adaptation to British conditions. We highlight the opportunity for monitored releases to be undertaken within the landscape highlighted here, so as to evaluate population growth, host plant use, and rates of colonisation away from release sites that differ in their management, habitat, host plant characteristics, and proximity to other sites. This approach would aim to develop knowledge as a ‘living lab’ to inform future ‘best practice’ releases. In conclusion, the black-veined white, A. crataegi, has potential to become a model species for assisted colonisation projects where natural and human-created barriers have prevented range expansion into regions where the 21st century climate is suitable for a species.",

(2011) supported that characteristics found in AAE help avoid commonly observed developmental errors in the comprehension of wh-questions. Prior work on mainstream American English (MAE) has shown that where and what are acquired before who, how, why, which, and when. Research on passive voice revealed that children comprehend action verb passives earlier than non-action verb passives. We investigate the comprehen­sion of wh-questions and passive voice in 222 SAAE-, SE- and MAE-speaking children, aged 2-13 and examine whether there were certain structural environments where we examined the comprehension of wh-questions or passive voice that were more challenging for the three groups. The results show that SE and SAAE have comparable development with wh-questions and passive voice, with minor exceptions. They confirm findings from previous studies on both the order of acquisition of wh-questions and the earlier acquisition of action passives, as well as the SAAE-speaking participants’ highly accurate performance with wh-questions, especially structures which include indirect/medial questions.",

This article argues for the significance of Wikipedia for medievalists in terms of how it may shape research, pedagogy, and public-facing work. We examine three case studies—articles for the ‘Black Death,’ the ‘Viking Age,’ and ‘Old English literature’—to explore how the medieval is forged, defined by us as crafted and created, ‘on-Wiki.’ We discuss what these forgings suggest about public understanding, desires, and interests, and the ideas about the past that emerge as a result. Our case studies demonstrate varied approaches to Wiki content, including citation review, readings of version histories, and pageview analysis. It is intended that this article provokes further discussion of Wikipedia as a site of medieval public history and inspires our colleagues to engage as critics, editors, teachers, or activists.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was used to measure population levels of conceptual alignment among two polar sensory metaphors and clusters of concepts to which they are commonly applied. A total of 873 participants were tested online, to compare within- and between-cluster alignments of concepts associated with two different polar sensory metaphors (up/down and black/white). IAT results were sensitive to semantic alignments that were also picked up by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) using a large-scale corpus of English. However, even with these semantic alignments taken into account, the dual categorization results demonstrated strong metaphor-cluster alignments over and above the predictions of LSA. It is proposed that, rather than ontogenetic development of metaphoric concepts based on sensorimotor experience, conventionalized sensorimotor metaphors in language may be cognitive tools that provide language learners with insights supported by conceptual properties of a phylogenetically evolved perceptual interface.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Transcription of conjoined independent clauses within language samples varies across professionals. Some transcribe these clauses as two separate utterances, whereas others conjoin them within a single utterance. As an inquiry into equitable practice, we examined rates of conjoined independent clauses produced by children and the impact of separating these clauses within utterances on measures of mean length of utterance (MLU) by a child's English dialect, clinical status, and age. Method: The data were archival and included 246 language samples from children classified by their dialect (African American English or Southern White English) and clinical status (developmental language disorder [DLD] or typically developing [TD]), with those in the TD group further classified by their age (4 years [TD4] or 6 years [TD6]). Results: Rates of conjoined independent clauses and the impact of these clauses on MLU varied by clinical status (DLD < TD) and age (TD4 < TD6), but not by dialect. Correlations between the rate of conjoined clauses, MLU, and language test scores were also similar across the two dialects. Conclusions: Transcription decisions regarding conjoined independent clauses within language samples lead to equitable measurement outcomes across dialects of English. Nevertheless, transcribing conjoined independent clauses as two separate utterances reduces one's ability to detect syntactic differences between children with and without DLD and document syntactic growth as children age.

        "abstract": "Purpose: Syntax provides critical support for both academic success and linguistic growth, yet it has not been a focus of language research in school-age African American children. This study examines complex syntax performance of African American children in second through fifth grades. Method: The current study explores the syntactic performances of African American children (N = 513) in Grades 2–5 on the Test of Language Development–Intermediate who speak African American English. Multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the growth and associated changes between dialect density and syntax. Analyzed data were compared both to the normative sample and within the recruited sample. Results: The results suggest that dialect density exerted its impact early but did not continue to influence syntactic growth over time. Additionally, it was not until dialect density was accounted for in growth models that African American children's syntactic growth resembled normative expectations of a standardized language instrument. Conclusion: The current study suggests that failure to consider cultural language differences obscures our understanding of African American students' linguistic competence on standardized language assessments.",

        "abstract": "Dear readers, \nI am pleased to introduce the 2023 Issue of the International Journal of Child and Adolescent Resilience (IJCAR). This issue includes: two regular articles on trauma and maltreatment and associated impacts; three brief reports on varying aspects of hardships and resilience in different populations; and one theoretical paper about a narrative shelter model to give youth who experienced violence a voice and choice. \nIn particular, the regular articles shed light on hardships and resilience experienced by differing populations. Bégin and colleagues examined the effects of using the internet survey method compared to a population-based telephone survey method on the profile of women with a history of child sexual abuse, in terms of socio-demographic data, victimization experiences, and mental health symptoms in adulthood. Jamison and colleagues aimed to gain insights on youth of color in the United States who have experienced violence regarding the associations between resilience and psychological health, social support, and school engagement. \nFurthermore, the 2023 issue of IJCAR also includes three brief reports on different topics associated to experiences of trauma, maltreatment, and resilience in various populations. Firstly, Brend et al. compared a sample of Finnish social workers serving children and families or social workers in other domains, in terms of the associations between moral distress and burnout amongst these groups. Secondly, Frederickson et al. investigated whether child maltreatment predicted the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and symptom clusters for Canadian women during pregnancy, as well as changes in symptoms from pregnancy to three months postpartum. Finally, Souza et al. aimed to determine if social media in Brazil is a viable outlet for the dissemination of empirically supported information surrounding the topics of child abuse, adverse childhood events, and resilience. \nFinally, the issue ends with a theoretical paper by Nyirinkwaya and Jenney, regarding a shelter narrative model for research and practice on childhood experiences of intimate partner violence in young people, in order to integrate storytelling and storylistening to help youth exercise their voice and choice. Thus, we encourage you to read these various articles to obtain rich information about ongoing research in the field of resilience. \nI wish to also take this opportunity to sincerely thank all the members of the IJCAR team for their continuous and dedicated work in the editing and publishing process. Particularly, I wish to thank our associate editors, Dr. Tara Black, Dr. Delphine Collin-Vézina, Dr. Isabelle Daigneault, Dr. Rachel Langevin, and Dr. Nicole Racine; layout editor, Manon Robichaud; and managing editor and senior copyeditor, Teresa Pirro, all of which have done a fantastic job in their varying roles. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Dr. Roxanne Guyon as a new associate editor. We hope you enjoy reading the current issue! \nThis is also a friendly reminder to prepare your manuscripts for the next issue. Please submit your manuscripts in English, or in French, and feel free to forward this information to colleagues and students who may be interested. We look forward to your manuscripts and to the next issue of IJCAR. \nHappy reading! \nMartine Hébert, Editor-in-Chief",

        "abstract": "Study Background The effects of systemic racism were exacerbated and amplified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of the “Black Lives Matter” movement in North America brought awareness to the public, especially white people, of the impacts of systemic racism in society and the urgent need for large-scale and institutional anti-racism work. Purpose In collaboration with a local Community Health Centre, this research focused on identifying priority areas for tailored and co-developed anti-Black racism interventions in health services and community programming, as well as examining how purposeful relationships can be created with African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) communities in London, Ontario. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted in either French or English with nine formal or informal leaders from London's ACB communities. Interpretive description methodology guided analysis and interpretation. Results Participants indicated that anti-Black racism is ever-present in the community and in their lives, with systemic racism causing the most harm. Racism should be addressed by creating ACB-specific services, and education for non-Black communities; increased representation, inclusion, and engagement of ACB people within organizations, especially in leadership roles, are essential. A framework based on study findings to guide how organizations can develop authentic and purposeful relationships with ACB communities is presented. Conclusions Organizations will continue to perpetuate systemic racism unless they actively seek to be anti-racist and implement strategies and policies to this end. The proposed framework can guide partnerships between health and community organizations and ACB communities, and support co-development of strategies to address anti-Black racism.",

        "abstract": "Colour is a silent language with the help of which people can communicate. It is rich in hidden meanings and symbolisms. We think of colour as an independent concept with a part to play in every aspect of our lives. Colour, as we know, does not exist in the outside world, beyond us, like gravity, protons and oxygen do. Instead, colour is created inside our heads. It is the characteristic of human visual perception. The recognition and interpretation of colour are determined by numerous factors: cultural, religious, spiritual, physiological, and psychological. Colour terms are widely used in phraseological units. Among most common ones are the idioms with the two opposite spectra – colours black and white. The present article discusses the perception of black and white in English and Armenian idioms. The current research is an attempt aimed at revealing the similarities and differences in these two languages through comparative-contrastive and descriptive methods of analysis.",

On the basis of linguistic data from 11th‐century Britain (Old English), 14th‐century Norway (Old Norse), 19th‐century Ireland (Early Modern Irish English and Modern Irish), 20th‐century Hong Kong (Hong Kong English) as well as 21st century South Africa (Black South African English), the discussion establishes verbal threats as socio‐pragmatic modes of action, that is, commissives that come as both illocutionary and perlocutionary acts. The main aim of the article is to elaborate on the central role that sociocultural norms and conventions play in the enregisterment of threat in a speech community at a given point in time. The article contributes to the development of forensic–linguistic threat assessment through a stronger focus on the sociocultural embeddedness of threatening discourses.",

Most notable was the similarity of student responses regardless of demographic characteristics. However, students already in paid work were significantly more likely to agree that they liked the university and found it easy to make friends. Students who might consider taking on paid work expressed significantly more concern that they may struggle with their academic work whilst those not in paid work had significantly more concerns about exams and self-directed learning. In terms of transferable academic skills, Black students were significantly less likely than white students to expect to make detailed class notes for themselves, albeit within this small sample size, while those first-in-family identified more academic skills needs than other student groups. Significantly more staff than students considered classroom attendance necessary. This pilot study suggests future research directions, including the impact of paid work and ethnicity on specific academic skills and underlines the importance of student support.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe dengue virus is a significant global public health concern that poses a threat to Africa. Particularly, African countries are at risk of viral introductions through air travel connectivity with areas of South America and Asia that experience frequent explosive outbreaks. Limited reporting and diagnostic capacity hinder a comprehensive assessment of continent-wide transmission dynamics and deployment of surveillance strategies in Africa.\n\nMethodsThe risk of dengue introduction into Africa from countries of high incidence was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows and epidemic activity at origin. We produced a novel proxy for local dengue epidemic activity using a composite index of theoretical climate-driven transmission potential and population density, which we used, along with travel information in a risk flow model, to estimate the importation risks.\n\nFindingsWe find that countries in east Africa face higher risk of importation from Asia, whereas for west African countries, larger risk of importation is estimated from South America. Some countries with high risk of importation experience low local transmission potential which likely hampers the chances that importations lead to local establishment and transmission. Conversely, Mauritius, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Kenya are identified as countries susceptible to dengue introductions during periods of persistent transmission suitability.\n\nInterpretationOur work improves the data driven allocation of surveillance resources, in regions of Africa that are at high risk of dengue introductions and establishment. This will be critical in detecting and managing imported cases and can improve local response to dengue outbreaks.\n\nFundingRockefeller Foundation, National Institute of Health, EDCTP3 and Horizon Europe Research and Innovation, World Bank Group, Medical Research Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Google.org, Oxford Martin School Pandemic Genomics programme, John Fell Fund\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDespite the significant global burden of dengue virus globally, Africa remains relatively understudied due to limited reporting and diagnostic capabilities. We searched PubMed for articles in English published on and before May 6, 2024, that included \"Dengue OR dengue\", \"Africa\", and \"importation OR imported\". Few studies have investigated the introduction of dengue into African countries. Limited evidence includes phylogeographic studies describing a potential introduction of dengue from Brazil into Angola in 2013 and evidence of multiple historical introductions of dengue from Asia to Africa over several years. Before our study, none had employed a modelling framework to investigate the continental risks of importing dengue via viremic travellers into African countries from other regions of high dengue incidence.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study provides a novel approach to assessing the risk of dengue importation into Africa, integrating temperature-dependent transmission potential and air travel data. By identifying high-risk regions and highlighting the complex interplay between travel patterns, population density, and ecological factors, our findings enhance the understanding of dengue dynamics in Africa. This information enables targeted allocation of surveillance resources, improving preparedness and response to potential dengue outbreaks in susceptible regions.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe integration of transmission potential as local epidemic activity and air travel data into a risk flow metric provides valuable insights into the risk of dengue importation into African airports from high-incidence countries. These findings have implications for tailored surveillance and prevention strategies in high-risk regions, facilitating early detection and management of potential dengue imported cases outbreaks in Africa.",

        "title": "Styling Authenticity in Country Music",
        "abstract": "Country music has become commercially successful both in the US and worldwide. It is perceived as a genre that values authenticity, which may be reflected in the choice of linguistic features, with (White) Southern American English (SAE) serving as the “default” variety. Given the recent diversification of the genre, the question arises whether the use of SAE features is still considered obligatory as a kind of “supralocal norm”. This study compared the lyrics of 600 highly successful songs by male and female artists from White Southern, Black Southern, and White non-Southern backgrounds. The aim was to test (i) whether morphosyntactic SAE features are used to index authenticity in the sense of having become enregistered for this music genre and (ii) whether non-Southerners engage in the styling of relevant markers. It emerged that non-Southerners use more of these features than their Southern counterparts, providing preliminary evidence for “genre fitting” as a means of indexing authenticity. However, there is only one marker that qualifies as a core Country feature used across all artist groups, namely negative concord. As this item arguably is better categorized as vernacular universal, SAE morphosyntax appears to have largely lost its indexical function in Country, while accent features are still vital to establishing cultural authenticity.",

        "abstract": "Background The most effective injective treatment approach for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain remains unclear. Aim of this study was to quantify the safety and effectiveness of the available injective strategies to address SIJ pain. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception until January 2023. Inclusion criteria were studies written in English, comparative and non-comparative studies regardless of the minimum follow-up, and case series on SIJ injections. Safety and efficacy of the different injection therapies for the SIJ were quantified. A meta-analysis was conducted on the available data of the documented injective therapies. The “Checklist for Measuring Quality” by Downs and Black was used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of papers. Results The literature search retrieved 43 papers (2431 patients): 16 retrospective case series, 2 retrospective comparative studies, 17 prospective case series, 3 prospective comparative studies, and 5 randomized controlled trials. Of the selected studies, 63% examined the effect of steroid injections, 16% of PRP injections, while 21% reported other heterogeneous treatments. The failure rate was 26% in steroid injections and 14% in PRP injections. The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in pain with the VAS score for both steroids and PRP: steroids improvement at mid-term 3.4 points (p < 0.05), at long-term 3.0 (p < 0.05), PRP improvement at mid-term 2.2 (p = 0.007), at long-term 2.3 points of the VAS pain scale (p = 0.02). Conclusions Steroids are the most documented injective approach, with studies showing an overall safety and effectiveness. Still, the high number of failures underlined by some studies suggest the need for alternative procedures. Early PRP data showed promise, but the limitations of the current literature do not allow to clearly define the most suitable injective approach, and further studies are needed to identify the best injective treatment for SIJ patients.",

        "title": "Changing socio-demographic determinants of seasonal influenza acceptance in England during the pandemic and a framework for predicting future acceptance",
        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the current level of seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance in England and establish the evolving socio-demographic determinants of seasonal influenza uptake and intent-to-vaccinate behaviours between 2020 and 2022. To provide a framework for predicting future rates of seasonal influenza uptake at sub-national scales in England. Design: Two cross-sectional online surveys analysed using a Bayesian time-series multilevel model followed by poststratification to re-weight against English census data. Setting: England, September 2020 to July 2022. Participants: 28,748 English adults, 18 years of age and older. Main outcome measures Three response variables: whether an individual was offered a seasonal influenza vaccine on the NHS in the last 12 months, whether this offer was accepted, and whether they would accept a seasonal influenza vaccine in the next 12 months. Results: In the 2021-22 flu season, 56.3% of adults in England were offered the seasonal influenza vaccine, marking a significant increase of 10.7 percentage points compared to the 2019-20 season. Notably, acceptance of the seasonal influenza vaccine saw a marked rise during this period, par- ticularly among individuals aged 50 and over. However, intentions to accept the vaccine in the next 12 months showed a slight decline across the entire adult population between 2020 and 2022 surveys, although there was an increase among individuals aged 65 and over. Socio-demographic traits play a significant role in shaping vaccine behaviours, with age, gender, education, ethnicity, and religion influencing the likelihood of being offered the vaccine, accepting it when offered, and intending to receive future vaccinations. Noteworthy differences were observed across demographic groups, with smaller gaps among individuals aged 65 and over, particularly between Black/Black British and White respondents. Of particular concern is waning intent-to-accept behaviours among Asian and Asian British groups, as well as Hindus and Punjabi speakers. Regional disparities also emerged, with estimates for flu vaccine receipt and future intent being lowest in London, especially inner London. Moreover, forecasts generated from 2022 data regarding future flu vaccine uptake correlated well with the observed UK Health Security Agency-reported uptake in the subsequent 2022-23 flu season. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant progress made in increasing seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among adults in England during the 2021-22 flu season, particularly among the older population. However, despite these improvements, disparities persist across socio-demographic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address barriers to vaccine acceptance. The slight decline in intention to accept the vaccine in the next 12 months among the general adult population warrants attention and suggests the importance of ongoing efforts to promote vaccine confidence and accessibility. Furthermore, the regional disparities observed emphasize the importance of tailoring vaccination strategies to address specific geographical contexts. The strong correlation between predicted vaccine uptake and observed data indicates the potential utility of pre- dictive modelling in informing public health interventions. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and public health practitioners to enhance influenza vaccination efforts and mitigate the burden of influenza-related illness in England.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children, yet parental hesitancy towards vaccinating children against the virus persists. We conducted a telephone-administered weighted survey in Texas to examine parents’ sociodemographic factors and medical conditions associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention for parents with unvaccinated children ages 5–17 years. We collected responses from 19,502 participants, of which 4879 were parents of children ages 5–17 years. We conducted multiple logistic regression with Lasso-selected variables to identify factors associated with children’s vaccination status and parents’ intention to vaccinate their children. From the unweighted sample, less than half of the parents (46.8%) had at least one unvaccinated child. These parents were more likely to be White, English-speaking, not concerned about illness, privately insured, and unvaccinated for COVID-19 themselves (p < 0.001). In the adjusted regression model, parents who were unvaccinated (vs. having COVID-19 booster, aOR = 28.6) and financially insecure (aOR = 1.46) had higher odds of having unvaccinated children. Parents who were Asian (aOR = 0.50), Black (aOR = 0.69), Spanish-speaking (aOR = 0.57), concerned about illness (aOR = 0.63), had heart disease (aOR = 0.41), and diabetes (aOR = 0.61) had lower odds of having unvaccinated children. Parents who were Asian, Black, Hispanic, Spanish-speaking, concerned about illness for others, and vaccine-boosted were more likely to have vaccination intention for their children (p < 0.001). Children’s vaccination is essential to reduce COVID-19 transmission. It is important to raise awareness about the value of pediatric COVID-19 vaccination while considering parents’ sociodemographic and medical circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Aims Robotic-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (R-UKA) has been proposed as an approach to improve the results of the conventional manual UKA (C-UKA). The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyze the studies comparing R-UKA and C-UKA in terms of clinical outcomes, radiological results, operating time, complications, and revisions. Methods The literature search was conducted on three databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science) on 20 February 2024 according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Inclusion criteria were comparative studies, written in the English language, with no time limitations, on the comparison of R-UKA and C-UKA. The quality of each article was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist for Measuring Quality. Results Among the 3,669 articles retrieved, 21 studies on 19 series of patients were included. A total of 3,074 patients (59.5% female and 40.5% male; mean age 65.2 years (SD 3.9); mean BMI 27.4 kg/m2 (SD 2.2)) were analyzed. R-UKA obtained a superior Knee Society Score improvement compared to C-UKA (mean difference (MD) 4.9; p < 0.001) and better Forgotten Joint Score postoperative values (MD 5.5; p = 0.032). The analysis of radiological outcomes did not find a statistically significant difference between the two approaches. R-UKA showed longer operating time (MD 15.6; p < 0.001), but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA (5.2% vs 10.1% and 4.1% vs 7.2%, respectively). Conclusion This meta-analysis showed that the robotic approach for UKA provided a significant improvement in functional outcomes compared to the conventional manual technique. R-UKA showed similar radiological results and longer operating time, but reduced complication and revision rates compared to C-UKA. Overall, R-UKA seems to provide relevant benefits over C-UKA in the management of patients undergoing UKA. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2024;5(5):374–384.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To collect and document the numerous barriers that people living with hepatitis B (PLHB) encounter when trying to access their hepatitis B virus (HBV) medications. Design Researchers collected qualitative data through 24 online interviews. The semistructured interview questions focused on the impact that HBV has on different aspects of daily life (physical, emotional and social), personal experiences managing their infection, HBV treatment experiences and interactions with healthcare providers. Setting All interviews occurred over Zoom. Participants The participant cohort consisted of 12 males and 12 females. 63% of all participants represented communities of colour (37% white, 17% black/African/African American and 46% Asian/Asian American). Most of the participants were on antiviral treatment at the time of the study (62%). Participants were PLHB (self-reported), ≥18 years old, living in the USA or Canada and spoke English. Results Participants reported several barriers to accessing medicine among PLHB including financial barriers, health insurance and pharmacy preauthorisation process and other intangible barriers like lack of access to reliable patient-friendly information and stigma. The identified barriers to accessing HBV medication impacted patients’ continuity of care. Conclusions Access to medicine is essential to improving health outcomes. PLHB experience significant barriers to accessing HBV antivirals at different levels. Patient-related, physician-related and healthcare system barriers were identified as themes contributing to antiviral access challenges. More research is needed to identify strategies to improve access to HBV medications.",

Methods: Study involved a cross-sectional survey with 1,713 adults. Recruitment occurred between June and November 2021 with eligible individuals who had previously received a COVID-19 diagnosis through designated testing sites. The LA County Department of Public Health operated a culturally responsive program for contact tracing that included provision of education and service referrals to newly diagnosed cases through much of the pandemic. Results: Participants were majority female (63%), Hispanic/Latino/a/x (64%), ages 18–40 (69%), and surveyed in English (77%). Overall contact-tracing experiences were rated positively, regardless of demographics (average means of 3.1–3.2/4.0). Those surveyed in Spanish were more likely to endorse positive statements if their contact tracer also spoke Spanish. Although over 75% of participants shared a range of the different information types requested, 49–52% endorsed concerns about data security and uses of the solicited information. Conclusions: Despite eliciting some concerns, contact-tracing efforts were generally positively received. Policy implications: Investments in contact tracing in similar communities should consider language-concordant contact tracers, community-based health worker training in trust building, and addressing social and health needs.",

This scoping review aimed to map the evidence on how pulses contribute to overall human health. Four electronic databases were searched for clinical and observational studies in English. We identified 30 articles (3 cross-sectional studies, 1 federated meta-analysis, 8 prospective cohort studies, 1 before-and-after study, and 17 randomized controlled trials) that met our inclusion criteria. Predominant among the pulses studied were lentils, chickpeas, common bean varieties (e.g., pinto, black, navy, red, kidney), black-eyed peas, cowpeas, and split peas. Consumption modalities varied; most studies examined mixed pulses, while five isolated individual types. In intervention studies, pulses were incorporated into diets by allotting a fixed pulse serving on top of a regular diet or by substituting red meat with pulses, offering a comparative analysis of dietary effects. The health outcomes evaluated were multifaceted, ranging from lipid profiles to blood pressure, cardiovascular disease risk and mortality, type 2 diabetes and glycemic control, metabolic syndrome indicators, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress biomarkers, and hormonal profiles. The most frequently assessed study outcomes included changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, waist circumference, and C-reactive protein or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This review should serve as a call to action for the scientific community to build upon the existing evidence, enriching our understanding of the nutritional and health-promoting attributes of pulses.",

        "abstract": "Objective To systematically map evidence to answer the research question: What is the relationship between the characteristics of children and young people (CYP) or their caregivers and primary care service use in the UK, taking into account underlying healthcare needs? Design Scoping review. Setting Primary care. Eligibility criteria English-language quantitative or mixed-methods studies published between 2012 and 2022. Data sources Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index, and grey literature. Results 22 eligible studies were identified, covering general practice (n=14), dental health (n=4), child mental health (MN) services (n=3) and immunisation (n=1). Only eight studies (36%) controlled for variables associated with healthcare need (eg, age, birth weight and long-term conditions). In these, evidence of horizontal inequity in primary care use was reported for CYP living in deprived areas in England, with and without complex needs. Horizontal inequity was also identified in primary care MN referrals for CYP in England identifying as mixed-race, Asian or black ethnicity, compared with their white British peers. No evidence of horizontal inequity was observed, however, in primary care use for CYP in England exposed to parental depression, or for CYP children from low-income households in Scotland. Increasing CYP’s age was associated with decreasing primary care use across included studies. No studies were found regarding CYP from Gypsy or Traveller communities, children in care, or those with disabilities or special educational needs. Conclusions There is evidence that socioeconomic factors impact on CYP’s primary care use, in particular age, ethnicity and deprivation. However, better quality evidence is required to evaluate horizontal inequity in use and address knowledge gaps regarding primary care use for vulnerable CYP populations and the impact of policy and practice related ‘supply side’ of primary care.",

        "abstract": "\n \n To determine the global level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards dengue fever among the general population.\n \n \n \n To complete this systematic review and meta-analysis, a thorough search for pertinent English-language literature was undertaken during the study's extension until October 2023. The search used Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Science, EMBASE, Springer, and ProQuest. A quality assessment checklist developed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for the cross-sectional study was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the included papers. Inverse variance and Cochran Q statistics were employed in the STATA software version 14 to assess study heterogeneity. When there was heterogeneity, the Dersimonian and Liard random-effects models were used.\n \n \n \n 59 Studies totaling 87353 participants were included in this meta-analysis. These investigations included 86278 participants in 55 studies on knowledge, 20196 in 33 studies on attitudes, and 74881 in 29 studies on practices. The pooled estimates for sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and dengue fever preventive behaviors among the general population were determined as 40.1% (95% CI 33.8%-46.5%), 46.8% (95% CI 35.8%-58.9%), and 38.3% (95% CI 28.4%-48.2%), respectively. Europe exhibits the highest knowledge level at 63.5%, and Africa shows the lowest at 20.3%. Positive attitudes are most prevalent in the Eastern Mediterranean (54.1%) and Southeast Asia (53.6%), contrasting sharply with the Americas, where attitudes are notably lower at 9.05%. Regarding preventive behaviors, the Americas demonstrate a prevalence of 12.1%, Southeast Asia at 28.1%, Western Pacific at 49.6%, Eastern Mediterranean at 44.8%, and Africa at 47.4%.\n \n \n \n Regional disparities about the knowledge, attitude and preventive bahaviors are evident with Europe exhibiting the highest knowledge level while Africa has the lowest. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted public health interventions tailored to regional contexts, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies to enhance dengue-related knowledge and encourage positive attitudes and preventive behaviors.\n",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe COVID-19 pandemic transformed healthcare delivery with the rapid adoption of telehealth and digital technologies to access healthcare. Interventions are needed to ensure that older people in underserved communities do not face new technology-driven healthcare disparities. This article describes pioneering electronic medical record (EMR) embedded tools to assess and support each diverse patient's digital health literacy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe designed and validated a rapid EMR-embedded Digital Health Engagement Tool (DHET) to assess each patient's digital literacy in English and Spanish. We built a separate, EMR-generated auto-scoring function to assess patient use of telehealth and healthcare navigation as recorded within the EMR. Combined, the tools created a complete digital literacy assessment for each patient. We then deployed the tools to conduct a pilot study to elucidate disparities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 112 ethnic/racial diverse older patients were enrolled (mean age was 78, ranging from 57 to 96) years (SD = 8.04). The female participants were 72.3%. Among the participants, non-Hispanic Whites were 47.3%; Hispanic 25.0%; non-Hispanic Asian 19.6%; non-Hispanic others (including multi-race and non-Hispanic Black/African Americans) 8.0%. Digital literacy disparities were revealed for older adults, particularly those over 70 years old, female gender, and those reporting relying on a helper.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNew EMR-embedded tools enable healthcare systems to assess the ability of patients to navigate and utilize EMR capabilities, such as video telehealth appointments, messaging providers, reviewing labs/radiology reports, and requesting prescriptions. The study identified significant challenges for older patients in navigating EMRs and calls for healthcare systems to better support patient learning.",

        "abstract": "People from Nigeria were thrown to different corners of the world in the course of slavery. The dispersal curiously created financial enduring financial fortunes for European states and their people. Many of the slaves were assembled in today’s United States of America. The Europeans returned to force their way into the communities of the Africans in the name of colonialism. Great wealth transfer occurred, which continues to this day. What is usually not mentioned is the destruction of the local people’s cultures that took place. England stage-managed a war in Nigeria; a war designed to permanently plant English foot in Nigeria. Nigeria became the kitchen for crude oil to service English lifestyle and industries. The weight of English economic program in Nigeria is too much for the natives to bear. Nigeria is further reduced to a beggar colony. The outcome is also a hopeless citizenry seeking succour in England and other parts of the world. There are deficiencies noticed in all aspects of Nigerian life. Unfortunately, there is increasing defence among Nigerians of the role of England in the predicament of Nigeria, thus throwing open the debate on colonisation. This work identifies English roles in Nigeria’s and correctly lays the blame on the West, especially England. Popular assumptions by many British people that their country is not appreciated for civilizing the Nigerians is gaining support from the young people in Nigeria. The purpose of the essay is also to initiate a vigorous re-education of young people on the subject matter. The work is influenced by debates this writer followed on Facebook. Books, newspaper and journal articles are the sources of the materials used for this essay.",

        "abstract": "In Brazil and around the world, the problems resulting from urban planning, changes in land cover and the increase in urban infrastructure influence temperature change. The aim of this research is to understand the difference in temperature over the last 36 years (1985-2021) in the city of Cuiabá/MT, and its relationship with vegetation and socioeconomic and racial-ethnic factors. Annual images (36 images) from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites between 1985 and 2021 were used, and Google Earth Engine was used to obtain this data for the urban area of the city of Cuiabá. Mapping of the spatial distribution of surface temperature, vegetation and changes in land use and cover was carried out using data from the MapBiomas project and socio-economic data from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE, Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in English) 2010 census. The results indicated that over the last 36 years Cuiabá's surface temperature has increased by an average of 13°C, as part of the result of the growth of urban infrastructure and loss of vegetation cover, specifically in the peripheral areas. There is an inequality between the high-income population living in neighborhoods with milder temperatures and the low-income population living in neighborhoods with higher temperatures. In the temperature and skin color data, the white population generally lives in neighborhoods with milder temperatures, unlike the black population, which mostly suffers from high temperatures.",

Using BERT models pre-trained on English language books, news articles, Wikipedia, Reddit and Twitter, with a new method for measuring propositions in natural language (the Fill-Mask Association Test, FMAT), we explored the gender (masculinity-femininity), physical strength, warmth and competence contents of stereotypes about Asian and Black men and women. We find that Asian men (but not women) are stereotyped as less masculine and less moral/trustworthy than Black men. Compared to Black men and Black women, respectively, both Asian men and Asian women are stereotyped as less muscular/athletic and less assertive/dominant, but more sociable/friendly and more capable/intelligent. These findings suggest that Asian and Black stereotypes in natural language have multifaceted contents and gender nuances, requiring a balanced view integrating the gender schema theory and the stereotype content model. Exploring their semantic representations as propositions in large language models, this research reveals how intersectional race-gender stereotypes are naturally expressed in real life.",

As such, it is unclear whether they generalize for analyzing use of English globally. To test this, we build a newswire dataset, the Worldwide English NER Dataset, to analyze NER model performance on low-resource English variants from around the world. We test widely used NER toolkits and transformer models, including models using the pre-trained contextual models RoBERTa and ELECTRA, on three datasets: a commonly used British English newswire dataset, CoNLL 2003, a more American focused dataset OntoNotes, and our global dataset. All models trained on the CoNLL or OntoNotes datasets experienced significant performance drops-over 10 F1 in some cases-when tested on the Worldwide English dataset. Upon examination of region-specific errors, we observe the greatest performance drops for Oceania and Africa, while Asia and the Middle East had comparatively strong performance. Lastly, we find that a combined model trained on the Worldwide dataset and either CoNLL or OntoNotes lost only 1-2 F1 on both test sets.",

Our purpose was to systematically review the literature about Kinesiophobia in athletes. A systematic review was conducted in February 2023 using PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Medline. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed, in English, within the last 20 years and included athletes who had been injured and tracked Kinesiophobia. Articles were checked for quality via the modified Downs and Black checklist. Fourteen studies were included in the review and had an average “fair” quality score. Authors examined Kinesiophobia in injured athletes with mostly lower-extremity injuries. Kinesiophobia was associated with lower physical and mental outcomes. Kinesiophobia exists in athletes and can affect both physical and mental factors. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was the most common tool used to examine Kinesiophobia. Common mental factors associated with Kinesiophobia include anxiety, low confidence, and fear avoidance.",

This essay offers five new English translations from his first collection Black Feathers (Svartar Fjaðrir,1919) and introduces a new decadent perspective. Decadence is widely regarded as flourishing in emergent modern societies, but, as this essay shows, its influence extended beyond western Europe. Written in a remote place, Stefánsson’s decadence speaks to an aesthetic of emptiness and atemporality. These poems broaden our conception of decadence and evidence a rich cultural hybridity, showing the influence of various traditions including symbolism, the Gothic, folk-songs, and decadence.",

        "title": "How Has South Africa’s Membership of BRICS Intensified Uneven and Combined Development in the Country and Beyond?",
        "abstract": "The recent African scramble has resulted in uneven and combined development (UCD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) throughout the 21st century due to unequal exchange. South Africa plays a sub-imperial role in this scramble in SSA. It both exploits and is exploited. The mining industry in South Africa has attracted interest from colonial powers, English-speaking businesses, and foreign investors, making it a highly lucrative sector. Furthermore, most black South Africans have been employed in the mining industry since the late 19th century. Over the past 25 years, the African National Congress government has utilised the mining industry to achieve economic transformation through black economic empowerment policies. This study proposes that the mining sector in South Africa is responsible for the ongoing UCD, despite receiving new investments and empowerment policies. South Africa’s inclusion in BRICS has broadened its range of international partners beyond its traditional Western or African counterparts. However, South Africa’s decision to join the BRICS group in 2011 has not yet yielded the expected transformation in the country’s economy and growth. As a result, it is uncertain whether South Africa’s BRICS membership has addressed the country’s persistent problem of UCD. This study argues that South Africa’s BRICS membership has exacerbated UCD in the country. This study proposes that Trotsky’s UCD analytical framework is useful for analysing South Africa’s policy choice to join BRICS, which strengthens its sub-imperial role.",

        "abstract": "Reforms to special education policy in England have emphasised the importance of parents being involved in decision-making about their child’s education and greater control over their child’s support. This study’s research questions investigated four Black African parents of children with special educational needs and disability (SEND) living in England and their experiences of working in partnership with education professionals to support their children, as well as exploring the barriers to effective partnership between Black African parents and education professionals. A critical approach was taken to understand how issues of power such as race and socio-economic status, combined with the parents own African culture, affected their interactions with education professionals who hold an entirely different contextual disposition. The parents took part in semi-structured interviews which were thematically analysed. Three overarching themes were identified: Communication (which focused on issues such as language, articulation and communication styles ); cultural barriers (which encompassed the cultural differences between the parents and the education professionals) ; and the parent-professional relationship (which was key for the parents to navigate the SEND system). Recommendations for practice such as professionals building more trust with parents, engaging more with cultural competency training and evaluating the accessibility of their current services are discussed.",

        "title": "602 Too Few Burn Papers and Images, Lowering Publication Barriers for Low- and Middle-Income Country Authors",
        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Whereas the burden of burn injury is greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), publications from these regions represent a disproportionately small volume of the published burn literature in English. This important gap in our cumulative knowledge contributes to the slow progress in global burn injury control. In addition to manuscripts, clinical photographs are important representations of injury and outcomes. We aimed to compare the current volume of burn publications and photographs to the global burn injury burden and sought to identify potential journal-level barriers to publication. Methods A bibliometric analysis was performed by sampling three leading burn surgery journals published in the English language (Journal of Burn Care and Research, Burns, European Burn Journal) between 2021-2023. Country of corresponding author and number of photos were tabulated and categorized by region. Volume was compared to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 estimates for incidence of thermal injury by region. Journal submission instructions were reviewed for potential barriers to publication. Results A total of 916 articles were reviewed from 59 countries. Analysis showed 147 articles with 1117 human photos. GBD incidence of burn, publications, and photographs by region are shown in Figure 1. North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania had a higher proportion of published images to burn injury incidence than Latin America, Africa, and Asia (X2 (6, N = 915) =3585, p < 0.001). Barriers to journal publication included charges for published images (up to 600 USD/image), open access costs (900-3500 USD with 1 of 3 publishers offering tiered discounts specific to LMIC), English language review (0.06-0.07 USD/word), and society affiliation discounts. Table 1 summarizes identified barriers and potential solutions. Conclusions There is a relative paucity of LMIC contributions to publications and clinical photos in English language burn journals. Identified publication barriers and added costs from journals likely contribute to this disparity. Applicability of Research to Practice Publication-level strategies to increase authorship and clinical photographs from underrepresented regions are urgently needed.",

        "title": "The Politics of Protestant Missions in the English Overseas Territories, 1660–1700",
        "abstract": "\nThrough the later seventeenth century, Protestant missions in English America were surrounded by controversy. Missionaries working with Amerindians and enslaved Africans were accused of threatening the stability of overseas dominions. Crown officials were alleged to have impeded evangelism, and colluded in a culture of colonial godlessness. In modern scholarship, these conflicts have been located within a context of long-term tension between “religion” and “empire.” This article suggests that they were rooted in the transatlantic divisions within English Protestantism, and in political conditions peculiar to the 1660 Restoration. Colonial missions developed competitively and acrimoniously, when the Church of England vied against Protestant rivals in America, and when ecclesiastical policy in England remained unsettled. Battles for converts between Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists stirred disputes over the management of England’s multi-confessional dominions. Simultaneously, they raised questions over how a colonizing kingdom could export the reformed religion, when its own confessional environment was severely divided.",

        "abstract": "Background Sexual assault occurring within healthcare settings represents a significant breach of public trust. This scoping review aimed to highlight the profile of people raped, those who committed the rape within the health facilities, and the legal actions taken to resolved cases. Methods Media-reported data on incidents of rape in healthcare settings were collected. The search was conducted in May and June 2023, focusing on English-language publications with accessible full texts. Reports that lacked information on the survivors or incidents that occurred outside of healthcare settings were excluded. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the categories of the collected publications, and graphical representations were employed for visualization purposes. Results A total of 62 cases were retrieved, originating from Africa ( n  = 17; 27.4%), Europe ( n  = 14; 22.6%), Southeast Asia ( n  = 14; 22.6%), the Americas ( n  = 11; 17.7%), the Western Pacific Region ( n  = 5; 8.1%) and Eastern Mediterranean region ( n  = 1; 1.6%). In addition, 69 individuals were implicated in 59 cases. They were 31 doctors (44.9%), 17 (24.6%) nurses, four (5.8%) nurse/healthcare assistants, three (4.3%) cleaners/ward boy, two (2.9%) traditional medical doctors, and two (2.9%) security guards. Others included six (8.7%) staff members without designations and one (1.4%) ambulance driver. All perpetrators were male, ranging in age from 22 to 67 years. There were 66 victims identified in the 62 cases with age ranging from 2 to 92 years. Except for one case, all victims were female, and all but one case were patients. Most assaults occurred in consulting rooms/clinics ( n  = 21; 31.8%), 16 (24.2%) happened under sedation, and six (9.1%) were repeatedly raped, Survivors typically reported the cases the police ( n  = 12; 19.4%), family/friends ( n  = 11; 17.7%) or to hospital authorities ( n  = 10; 16.1%). Out of the 69 perpetrators, 19 (30.6%) were imprisoned with sentences ranging from 12 months to an indefinite period and one (1.6%) received a death sentence. Conclusion The raping of patients by healthcare providers within healthcare settings calls for urgent and extensive measures. Stakeholders in healthcare management need to prioritize raising awareness about the problem, implement robust prevention and reporting strategies, and create healthcare environments that are safe, respectful, and supportive for all individuals seeking care.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Patient portals allowing access to electronic health care records and services can inform and empower, but may widen existing sociodemographic inequities. We aimed to describe associations between activation of a paediatric patient portal and patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and markers of previous engagement with health care. Methods A retrospective single site cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine patient portal adoption amongst families of children receiving care for chronic or complex disorders within the United Kingdom. Descriptive and multivariable regression analysis was undertaken to describe associations between predictors (Race/Ethnicity, age, socio-economic deprivation status based on family residence, and previous non-attendance to outpatient consultations) and outcome. Results A sample of 3687 children, representative of the diverse real world patient population, was identified. Of these 37% (1364) were from a White British background, 71% (2631) had English as the primary family spoken language (PSL), 14% (532) lived in areas of high deprivation, and 17% (643) had high (>33%) rates of non-attendance. The families of 73% (2682) had activated the portal. In adjusted analyses, English as a PSL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.66-2.36) was positively associated with portal activation, whilst families from British Black African backgrounds (aOR 0.58, 0.44-0.77), those living in areas of deprivation (aOR 0.81, 0.67-0.98) or with high rates of non-attendance (aOR 0.32, 0.27-0.39) were less likely to use the portal. Conclusions Socio-economic deprivation, race/ethnicity and previous low engagement with health care services are potentially key drivers of widening inequity in access to health care following the implementation of patient portals, a digital health innovation intended to inform and empower patients. Health care providers should be aware that innovative human-driven engagement approaches, targeted towards under-served communities, are needed to ensure equitable access to high quality patient-centred care.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To address a gap in radiation oncology education in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), we sought to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of a refined curriculum on intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) offered to existing radiation therapy (RT) clinics across Africa and Latin America (LATAM) at no cost. Methods A curriculum was created based on prior needs assessments and adapted for participating medical physicists, radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, and trainees in LMICs. English-speaking and Spanish-speaking teams of volunteer educators delivered 27 hour-long sessions 1–2 times weekly for 4 months using video conferencing to African and LATAM cohorts, respectively. Pre- and post-course multiple-choice examinations were administered to LATAM participants, and pre- and post-course self-confidence (1–5 Likert-scale) and open-ended feedback were collected from all participants. Results Twenty-five centers across Africa (13) and LATAM (12) participated, yielding a total of 332 enrolled participants (128 African, 204 LATAM). Sessions were delivered with a mean of 44 (22.5) and 85 (25.4) participants in the African and LATAM programs, respectively. Paired pre and post-course data demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) improvement in knowledge from 47.9 to 89.6% and self-confidence across four domains including foundations (+ 1.1), commissioning (+ 1.3), contouring (+ 1.7), and treatment planning (+ 1.0). Attendance was a significant predictor of change in self-confidence in “high attendance” participants only, suggesting a threshold effect. Qualitative data demonstrates that participants look forward to applying their knowledge in the clinical setting. Conclusion A specialized radiation oncology curriculum adapted for LMIC audiences was effective for both African and LATAM participants. Participant feedback suggests that the refined IMRT course empowered clinics with knowledge and confidence to help train others. This feasible “Hub and Spokes” approach in which a distance-learning course establishes a hub to be leveraged by spokes (learners) may be generalizable to others aiming to reduce global health care disparities through training efforts.",

        "title": "Sexual and reproductive health among forcibly displaced persons in urban environments in low and middle-income countries: scoping review findings",
        "abstract": "Background Most forcibly displaced persons are hosted in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). There is a growing urbanization of forcibly displaced persons, whereby most refugees and nearly half of internally displaced persons live in urban areas. This scoping review assesses the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs, outcomes, and priorities among forcibly displaced persons living in urban LMIC. Methods Following The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology we searched eight databases for literature published between 1998 and 2023 on SRH needs among urban refugees in LMIC. SHR was operationalized as any dimension of sexual health (comprehensive sexuality education [CSE]; sexual and gender based violence [GBV]; HIV and STI prevention and control; sexual function and psychosexual counseling) and/or reproductive health (antental, intrapartum, and postnatal care; contraception; fertility care; safe abortion care). Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature studies across quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods designs. Findings The review included 92 studies spanning 100 countries: 55 peer-reviewed publications and 37 grey literature reports. Most peer-reviewed articles (n = 38) discussed sexual health domains including: GBV (n = 23); HIV/STI (n = 19); and CSE (n = 12). Over one-third (n = 20) discussed reproductive health, including: antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care (n = 13); contraception (n = 13); fertility (n = 1); and safe abortion (n = 1). Eight included both reproductive and sexual health. Most grey literature (n = 29) examined GBV vulnerabilities. Themes across studies revealed social-ecological barriers to realizing optimal SRH and accessing SRH services, including factors spanning structural (e.g., livelihood loss), health institution (e.g., lack of health insurance), community (e.g., reduced social support), interpersonal (e.g., gender inequitable relationships), and intrapersonal (e.g., low literacy) levels. Conclusions This review identified displacement processes, resource insecurities, and multiple forms of stigma as factors contributing to poor SRH outcomes, as well as producing SRH access barriers for forcibly displaced individuals in urban LMIC. Findings have implications for mobilizing innovative approaches such as self-care strategies for SRH (e.g., HIV self-testing) to address these gaps. Regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean are underrepresented in research in this review. Our findings can guide SRH providers, policymakers, and researchers to develop programming to address the diverse SRH needs of urban forcibly displaced persons in LMIC. Plain English summary Most forcibly displaced individuals live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a significant number residing in urban areas. This scoping review examines the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes of forcibly displaced individuals in urban LMICs. We searched eight databases for relevant literature published between 1998 and 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. SRH was defined to include various dimensions of sexual health (comprehensive sexuality education; sexual and gender-based violence; HIV/ STI prevention; sexual function, and psychosexual counseling) and reproductive health (antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care; contraception; fertility care; and safe abortion care). We included 90 documents (53 peer-reviewed articles, 37 grey literature reports) spanning 100 countries. Most peer-reviewed articles addressed sexual health and approximately one-third centered reproductive health. The grey literature primarily explored sexual and gender-based violence vulnerabilities. Identified SRH barriers encompassed challenges across structural (livelihood loss), health institution (lack of insurance), community (reduced social support), interpersonal (gender inequities), and individual (low literacy) levels. Findings underscore gaps in addressing SRH needs among urban refugees in LMICs specifically regarding sexual function, fertility care, and safe abortion, as well as regional knowledge gaps regarding urban refugees in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Self-care strategies for SRH (e.g., HIV self-testing, long-acting self-injectable contraception, abortion self-management) hold significant promise to address SRH barriers experienced by urban refugees and warrant further exploration with this population. Urgent research efforts are necessary to bridge these knowledge gaps and develop tailored interventions aimed at supporting urban refugees in LMICs.

This paper examines the physical visibility of people of Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) descent in the U.S., and the linguistic visibility of a concentrated MENA American community in Dearborn, Michigan. Relying on headshots, Study 1 shows that MENA could be an ambiguous ethnic community based solely on physical appearance, while religiously affiliated attire proves to be a significant ethnic marker for MENA. Using audio cues, Study 2 shows that the English variety spoken in Dearborn is a recognizable variety with masculinity associations. As such, Dearborn English is argued to be an ethnolinguistic repertoire that can be used to project ethno-local visibility. The results highlight the importance of the linguistic visibility of Dearborn and future research on language attitudes towards this variety.",

        "title": "Cross-national examination of the Distress Tolerance Scale using Rasch methodology",
        "abstract": "The 15-item Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) is a widely used psychometric measure with evidence generally supporting its reliability and validity. However, limitations related to its ordinal response format and lack of cross-cultural comparisons have yet to be investigated using appropriate methods. The Partial Credit Rasch model was used to evaluate and enhance the psychometric properties of the DTS using responses from 2550 adult participants from the United States of America (USA), England, Canada, South Africa, Spain, and Argentina. The initial poor fit of the DTS to the Rasch model was improved by removing one item and combining locally dependent items into three testlets. These modifications resulted in the best fit of the 14-item DTS to the Rasch model for all the countries in our study, providing evidence of unidimensionality, high reliability and invariance across countries, meditation practice, and gender. Meeting the expectations of the Rasch model permitted the development of ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithms derived from person estimates of the Rasch model. Using the ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithms published in this article, ordinal DTS scores can be transformed into interval-level data, enhancing the precision of this scale for future research and clinical use across people from the six countries in this study and across the English and Spanish versions of the 14-item DTS.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of online learning platforms for facilitating knowledge translation in allied health professionals.\nMethodology: A systematic review of the literature searched three databases (Medline-OVID, CINAHL, Embase) in November 2023 for studies measuring outcomes of knowledge translation initiatives targeting allied health professionals delivered using online learning platforms. Papers were eligible if allied health professionals made up at least 50% of the sample, most of the learning component was online, and comparative data was reported. Data were extracted using a customised form. Quality of studies was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist. Meta-analyses were conducted where sufficient homogenous data were available.\nFindings: Twenty-three studies published over a 13-year period were included in this review primarily using pre-post study designs. All reported improvements in either knowledge, skill and/or confidence, with an meta-analysis (n=9 studies) showing a significant increase in knowledge gain after exposure to online learning (SMD 1.39; 95% CI = 0.96-1.83). However, there is little evidence that participation in online learning is associated with a change in clinical practice.\nResearch Implications: This study supports previous research that online learning can improve knowledge but highlights a need for more rigorous studies addressing the impacts on behaviour change.\nPractical Implications: Online learning is an effective way of improving knowledge, skill and/or confidence but additional knowledge translation strategies may be needed to lead to a behaviour change.\nOriginality/Value: Synthesis of current knowledge of the value and limitations of online learning as a tool to facilitate the implementation of evidence into practice in the allied health professions.\nLimitations: This review was limited to studies published in the English language only.  The quality of studies in this field is low. Few studies measure behaviour change.",

        "abstract": "The world-famous Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki (1949-) has been said to write universally-legible, made-to-be-translated fiction that is designed to circulate through the channels of global cultural commerce unimpeded by the thorny particularities of local specificity.  But this article explores a different side of Murakami—a side that attuned to the untranslatable particularity of socially contextualized language as he heard it spoken around him during his time living in the United States in the early 1990s.  Drawing on the scholar of comparative literature Michael Lucey’s approach to reading “the ethnography of talk,” the analysis focuses on how Murakami reconstructs a conversation about jazz that he had with a Black American interlocutor in New Jersey in the short essay “The Road Home From Berkeley” (Bākurē kara no kaerimichi), which appears in his volume of essays about living in the United States titled The Sadness of Foreign Language (Yagate kanashiki gaikokugo, 1994).  As the article compares the styles of speaking documented in “The Road Home From Berkeley” with those that appear in the English- and Japanese-language versions of Miles Davis’s autobiography Miles (which Murakami discusses in “The Road Home From Berkeley”) and J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (which Murakami translated himself), it reveals how Murakami has reflected on the specter of the untranslatable that haunts the global circulations of literature and pop culture.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent socio-demographic shifts in the United States have underscored the growing importance of informal caregiving and raised concerns about caregivers’ health and well-being. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the health dimensions of caregivers, considering their diverse backgrounds. Objective: To examine five key health dimensions (physical, cognitive, mental, social, and sexual health) of caregivers, and to identify potential disparities based on ethnoracial and linguistic differences. Methods: Using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), this study explores the interconnections among the specified health dimensions of caregivers and their ethnoracial (Black, Hispanic, White, and others) and linguistic (Spanish, English) backgrounds, in addition to their social networks (N=1,309). Regression analysis was employed to discern the patterns and associations. Results: The findings indicate that White caregivers generally report better physical, cognitive, and social health compared to their Black and Hispanic counterparts, but exhibit less favorable outcomes in sexual health than Hispanic caregivers. Spanish-speaking caregivers, while having lower cognitive and self-rated mental health than English-speaking caregivers, show stronger social health and greater relationship satisfaction. Notably, these correlations persist irrespective of the size of social networks, pointing to intrinsic links with health outcomes. Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of a comprehensive health evaluation for caregivers, acknowledging the intricate interplay between their health and various socio-demographic factors. It advocates for the development of targeted policies and interventions that address the complex health needs of caregivers, with an emphasis on their ethnoracial and linguistic contexts and social environments.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Despite the numerous efforts and initiatives, males with HIV are still less likely than women to receive HIV treatment. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, men are tested, linked, and retained in HIV care at lower rates than women, and South Africa is no exception. This is despite the introduction of the universal test-and-treat (UTT) prevention strategy anticipated to improve the uptake of HIV services. The aim of this study was to investigate linkage to and retention in care rates of an HIV-positive cohort of men in a high HIV prevalence rural district in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods From January 2018 to July 2019, we conducted an observational cohort study in 18 primary health care institutions in the uThukela district. Patient-level survey and clinical data were collected at baseline, 4-months and 12-months, using isiZulu and English REDCap-based questionnaires. We verified data through TIER.Net, Rapid mortality survey (RMS), and the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) databases. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15.1, with confidence intervals and p-value of ≤0.05 considered statistically significant. Results The study sample consisted of 343 male participants diagnosed with HIV and who reside in uThukela District. The median age was 33 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29–40), and more than half (56%; n = 193) were aged 18–34 years. Almost all participants (99.7%; n = 342) were Black African, with 84.5% (n = 290) being in a romantic relationship. The majority of participants (85%; n = 292) were linked to care within three months of follow-up. Short-term retention in care (≤ 12 months) was 46% (n = 132) among men who were linked to care within three months. Conclusion While the implementation of the UTT strategy has had positive influence on improving linkage to care, men’s access of HIV treatment remains inconsistent and may require additional innovative strategies.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Treatment choice when prescribing antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) is often influenced by safety and tolerability profiles. A transient increase in suicidality following antidepressant treatment initiation is a key concern. Although rare, its unpredictability and consequences make them a significant worry. In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a “black-box” warning regarding a potential increase in suicidality in adolescents receiving antidepressant treatment for depression that was later expanded to include both young adults and a broader range of antidepressants. Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of increased suicidality during the treatment with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in young adults with MDD. Methods We conducted a non-systematic literature search on PubMed using the combination of MeSH terms ([Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors] OR [Levomilnacipran] OR [Desvenlafaxine Succinate] OR [Venlafaxine Hydrochloride] OR [Duloxetine Hydrochloride]) AND [Suicide] AND [Young Adult], and the keywords [(“Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors” OR “Levomilnacipran” OR “Desvenlafaxine” OR “Venlafaxine” OR “Duloxetine”) AND (“Suicide” OR “treatment-emergent suicidal ideation”) AND (“Young” OR “Youth”)]. Results A total of 31 manuscripts were retrieved and 6 were selected, 3 original research and 3 non-systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials. Only studies written in English that provided information about suicidality with SNRIs in young adults with MDD. Globally, studies show that not only antidepressants decrease the risk of suicide attempt in depressed patients, but also there is no evidence of an increased suicidality in young adults treated with SNRIs. Interestingly, one study showed that increasing suicidality could be related to side effects of the treatment, such as anxiety, agitation and irritability. The authors found that poor antidepressant response and greater severity of depression during follow-up were associated with treatment increasing suicidal ideation, as it was suggested in another study. Another study reinforced that there may be an emotional component to the activating effects produced by some antidepressants that could explain their controversial association with rare cases of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Conclusions In conclusion, growing evidence shows that antidepressants overall decrease the risk of suicide attempt in depressed patients. Therefore, reducing antidepressant use over the FDA concerns about increased suicidal tendencies in young patients may actually increase suicide risks due to inadequate treatment of depression. Additional studies are essential to further confirm the importance of early treatment for depression. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

        "abstract": "Introduction It is important to promote resilience in preadolescence; however, there is limited research on children’s understandings and experiences of resilience. Quantitative approaches may not capture dynamic and context-specific aspects of resilience. Resilience research has historically focused on white, middle-class Western adults and adolescents, creating an evidence gap regarding diverse experiences of resilience in middle childhood which could inform interventions. East London’s Muslim community represents a diverse, growing population. Despite being disproportionately affected by deprivation and racial and cultural discrimination, this population is under-represented in resilience research. Using participatory and arts-based methods, this study aims to explore lived experiences and perceptions of resilience in black and South Asian Muslim children living in East London. Methods and analysis We propose a qualitative study, grounded in embodied inquiry, consisting of a participatory workshop with 6–12 children and their parents/carers to explore lived experiences and perceptions of resilience. Participants will be identified and recruited from community settings in East London. Eligible participants will be English-speaking Muslims who identify as being black or South Asian, have a child aged 8–12 years and live in East London. The workshop (approx. 3.5 hours) will take place at an Islamic community centre and will include body mapping with children and a focus group discussion with parents/carers to explore resilience perspectives and meanings. Participants will also complete a demographic survey. Workshop audio recordings will be transcribed verbatim and body maps and other paper-based activities will be photographed. Data will be analysed using systematic visuo-textual analysis which affords equal importance to visual and textual data. Ethics and dissemination The Queen Mary Ethics of Research Committee at Queen Mary University of London has approved this study (approval date: 9 October 2023; ref: QME23.0042). The researchers plan to publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and present findings at academic conferences.",

        "abstract": "Evidence suggests an association between exposure to electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) marketing and e-cigarette use (vaping) among adolescents. However, there is limited evidence on exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, especially among Black and Latino adolescents. This study aimed to examine associations between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping among Black and Latino adolescents in the United States (US). Participants (N = 362; equal representation between Black and Latino adolescents) completed a baseline assessment (available in English and Spanish) including sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic group, age, gender, sexual orientation, etc.), exposure to e-cigarette marketing, and susceptibility to future vaping. Exposure to e-cigarette marketing was recoded and organized into two categories (high exposure = 2 to 3; low exposure = 0 to 1). Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests were used to evaluate the association between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, stratified by racial/ethnic group. Multiple logistic regressions assessed the association between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and susceptibility to future vaping, controlling for gender, sexual orientation, grade, and academic performance within each racial/ethnic group. Black adolescents reported significantly higher frequencies of exposure to e-cigarette marketing (p = 0.005). A significant interaction was found between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and racial/ethnic group (X2 (1) = 6.294, p = 0.012). Among Black adolescents, high exposure to e-cigarette marketing (vs. low exposure) was associated with a higher probability of susceptibility to future vaping (OR: 2.399, 95% CI 1.147–5.021, p = 0.020). For Latino adolescents, exposure to e-cigarette marketing was not associated with susceptibility to future vaping (OR: 0.503, 95% CI 0.245–1.03, p = 0.062). Future studies should evaluate how and where adolescents are exposed to e-cigarette marketing. Prevention efforts must include the implementation of effective counter-marketing campaigns and the reduction of exposure to e-cigarette marketing among Black and Latino adolescents.",

Results show that speakers slowed their rate and produced less pitch variation in voice-assistant-\"directed speech\" (DS), relative to human-DS. These adjustments were not mediated by how often participants reported experiencing errors with automatic speech recognition. Overall, this paper addresses a limitation in the types of language varieties explored when examining technology-DS registers and contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of human-computer interaction.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Despite food pantries’ efforts to improve nutritional quality and encourage healthy cooking, limited evidence exists regarding pantry shoppers’ culinary preferences and kitchen equipment access. This project utilized pantry food demonstrations and samples to collect recipe and kitchen tool feedback. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: For 4 months, a Culinary Medicine team delivered food demonstrations at Crossroads Community Services food market in Dallas, Texas, which serves primarily Hispanic and Black residents. Each demo provided a food sample, corresponding printed recipe in English or Spanish, and a survey. Part 1 of the survey measured shoppers’ hedonic liking of the sampled food and their likelihood of recreating it. Part 2 used the same scale for non-sampled recipes adapted from Health meets Food Community Culinary Medicine programming. Averages of appeal and likelihood to cook between sampled and unsampled groups were compared with a student’s T test. Part 3 contained a visual graphic of 24 kitchen appliances, and shoppers circled each item they owned. Investigators collected surveys from 207 shoppers across 12 demos. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Preliminary analyses showed a positive response to the food demonstrations with a mean rating on a 5-point Likert scale of 4.58 for recipe appeal and 4.46 for likelihood of cooking the recipe at home. The Health meets Food recipes not demonstrated were also positively reviewed (4.40 for appeal and 4.32 for likelihood to cook). There was a statistically significant difference in appeal between sampled and non-sampled recipes (p = 0.03) while no significant difference was found for likelihood to cook (p = 0.08). On average, clients owned 75% of kitchen appliances with most clients owning a sauté pan (94%) but few having access to a food processor (27%). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: An effective nutrition program for food pantry clients must be accessible, culturally relevant, nourishing, and enjoyable. Providing samples alongside recipes may increase appeal and engagement. Consideration of kitchen equipment access is essential to promote recipe recreation at home.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Partnering with the Housing Authority of Los Angeles, we launched a place-based initiative in the Nickerson Gardens housing development in South Los Angeles, where we apply our community engagement approach of listening and learning, and trust and relationship building, to deliver public health interventions in a discrete community. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Nickerson Gardens is the largest housing development in Los Angeles, with 1,066 units and over 3,000 residents. 58% and 40% of the residents are Hispanic and Black/African American respectively with an average yearly income of less than $30,000. To build trust and establish relationships, our team began attending community events, holding weekly educational workshops, and participating in the summer program for youth. We also held listening sessions in English and Spanish that asked aboutthe overall health of the Nickerson Gardens community, environment and public space, access and barriers to care, needed healthcare services, and the lived experience within Nickerson Gardens. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: To date, we have held eight 90-minute listening sessions in English and Spanish with 59 participants. The sessions provided insight into theneeded health and educational resources and services, the organizational structure of the housing development and how that impacts access to information and services, as well as the nuanced and area-specific transportation issues and the connection to safety concerns. These findings will inform the next phase of this initiative which includes convening a Coordinating Council composed of service providers and Nickerson Gardens residents. This council will oversee the coordination and implementation of needed services, help maintain accountability of the providers, and offer residents the opportunity to take ownership of the process. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Academic-community partnerships are an effective strategy to deliver public health interventions and promote health equity in under-resourced communities. We tested and measured impact in a distinct community to reinforce a widely-applicable place-based model.",

Our goal was to describe parent perspectives to understand how to enhance family engagement in these activities, especially in low-income Black and Latinx communities. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We recruited parents through a large urban parks and recreation department located in Los Angeles County (LAC) and two community-based organizations who provide services primarily to low-income Black and Latinx residents in LAC. We conducted semi-structed English or Spanish interviews with parents of children ages 6-17 about the impact of activities on families, experiences making it difficult or easier for their child to be involved, and recommendations to meet their needs and facilitate family engagement. We coded the interviews using Dedoose and then performed thematic analysis. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We completed 34 interviews (17 English, 17 Spanish). Parents shared these central ideas about out-of-school activities: (1) they support families and promote healthy child development; (2) they must create a safe environment and promote a sense of belonging for all families; and (3) service delivery changes reduced barriers, but activities often remained inaccessible. Barriers included lack of awareness about low-cost options, online enrollment, financial costs, waitlists, program timing, inaccessible parks/pools, safety, inconsistent quality, few opportunities for families to participate together, and a desire for more inclusive practices around race, culture, language, gender, children with special needs, and parent involvement. Parents offered recommendations to increase family engagement. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Involving parents in optimizing out-of-school activities may improve access, uptake, and quality of these health-promoting activities in low-income Black and Latinx communities.",

        "abstract": "Aim Increasing evidence suggests that the inclusion of self-identified race in clinical decision algorithms may perpetuate longstanding inequities. Until recently, most pulmonary function tests utilized separate reference equations that are race/ethnicity based. Purpose We assess the magnitude and scope of the available literature on the negative impact of race-based pulmonary function prediction equations on relevant outcomes in African Americans with COPD. Methods We performed a scoping review utilizing an English language search on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science in September 2022 and updated it in December 2023. We searched for publications regarding the effect of race-specific vs race-neutral, race-free, or race-reversed lung function testing algorithms on the diagnosis of COPD and COPD-related physiologic and functional measures. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines were utilized for this scoping review. Eligibility criteria: The search was restricted to adults with COPD. We excluded publications on other lung disorders, non-English language publications, or studies that did not include African Americans. The search identified publications. Ultimately, six peer-reviewed publications and four conference abstracts were selected for this review. Results Removal of race from lung function prediction equations often had opposite effects in African Americans and Whites, specifically regarding the severity of lung function impairment. Symptoms and objective findings were better aligned when race-specific reference values were not used. Race-neutral prediction algorithms uniformly resulted in reclassifying severity in the African Americans studied. Conclusion The limited literature does not support the use of race-based lung function prediction equations. However, this assertion does not provide guidance for every specific clinical situation. For African Americans with COPD, the use of race-based prediction equations appears to fall short in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, classifying severity of impairment, or predicting subsequent clinical events. We do not have information comparing race-neutral vs race-based algorithms on prediction of progression of COPD. We conclude that the elimination of race-based reference values potentially reduces underestimation of disease severity in African Americans with COPD.",

        "abstract": "\n The purpose of this article is to identify early and recent Pentecostal studies in the West and to highlight the main difference between them. Today there are more than 250 million Pentecostals in the world, and together with the charismatic movement there are more than 500 million. Having begun to spread in the 20th century, the movement claims to be the fastest growing religious phenomenon in human history. In attempts to interpret the phenomenon of the movement's growth, there have been several gradually emerging approaches: explaining the origin of the movement as supernaturally \"coming from heaven\"; searching for the origins of Pentecostalism in other Christian movements; presenting the emergence of the movement as the result of social and psychological factors such as poverty, marginalization, and the desire to escape from modern society; and the multicultural approach. The paper analyzes the works of Western historians and theologians of Pentecostalism since the second half of the 20th century. The result shows a turning point between early and late studies, namely that late studies aim to revise the history and include participants in the movement around the world, not just in North America, explore the contribution to the development of the movement of local ministers who have long remained in the shadow of Western missionaries, emphasize the diversity of ideologies and social influences that have shaped the movement. It also highlights three major contemporary areas of research: historical, characterized by studies of Pentecostalism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; theological, focusing on the development and shaping of theoretical theology as a result of the movement's institutionalization; and religious studies, practiced primarily from the perspective of the sociology of religion.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background There are few qualitative studies of firearm injury survivors and hospital-based violence intervention programme (HVIP) participants. The original study aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to survivors’ utilisation of mental health services. This secondary analysis aimed to identify factors that may impact engagement with an HVIP. Study design This study was a subanalysis of an original qualitative study that used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semistructured interviews with English-speaking, intentional firearm injury survivors aged 13 and older within Indianapolis, Indiana between 2021 and 2022. Participants were recruited by a community organisation through a snowball sampling method. Interviews were analysed using manual thematic analysis. Themes were analysed and discussed in relation to HVIPs. Results A total of 18 interviews were completed. The majority of participants identified as black (17/18, 94.4%). Nearly all (75%) participants were between the ages of 13 and 24 years of age at the time of their shooting. During content analysis, five themes were identified: (1) delayed readiness to change, (2) desire for independence, (3) lack of trust, (4) persistent emotional and physical effects of trauma and (5) unawareness of HVIP resources. Conclusions This qualitative analysis of firearm injury survivor experiences provided insights for improved engagement with HVIPs. Continued pursuit of survivors for several years after their injury, improved dissemination of resources, establishing trust, and addressing persistent physical and psychological symptoms while respecting participants’ desire for independence may lead to increased engagement of firearm injury survivors with HVIPs.",

        "abstract": "Background Health disparities exist in end-of-life (EOL) care. Individuals and communities that are marginalized due to their race, ethnicity, income, geographic location, language, or cultural background experience systemic barriers to access and receive lower quality EOL care. Advance care planning (ACP) prepares patients and their caregivers for EOL decision-making for the purpose of promoting high-quality EOL care. Low engagement in ACP among marginalized populations is thought to have contributed to disparity in EOL care. To advance health equity and deliver care that aligns with the goals and values of each individual, there is a need to improve ACP for marginalized populations. Aim To describe how patients from marginalized populations experience and perceive ACP. Methods We used an interpretive phenomenological approach with semi-structured qualitative interviews. Participants were recruited from four primary care clinics and one nursing home in a US Pacific Northwest city. Thirty patients from marginalized populations with serious illness participated in individual interviews between January and December 2021. Participants were asked to describe their experiences and perceptions about ACP during the interviews. Results The mean age of 30 participants was 69.5; 19 (63%) were women; 12 (40%) identified as Asian/Pacific Islanders, 10 (33%) as Black; and 9 (30%) were non-native English speakers. Our three key findings were: 1) patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP; 2) there were multiple obstacles to engaging in ACP; and 3) meaningful ACP conversations could happen when clinicians listen. Although participants from marginalized populations were willing to engage in ACP, a fragmented and restrictive healthcare system and clinicians’ biased behaviors or lack of interest in knowing their patients were obstacles. Participants who felt their clinicians took time and listened were encouraged to engage in ACP. Conclusion Patients from marginalized populations are willing to engage in ACP conversations despite a common belief otherwise. However, obstacles to meaningful ACP conversations with healthcare providers exist. Clinicians need to be aware of these obstacles and listen to build trust and engage marginalized patients in mutually meaningful ACP conversations.",

        "abstract": "Background. Several disparities exist for Black mothers during the postpartum period, including but not limited to increased maternal mortality and morbidity rates, decreased access to care, and limited access to resources. Given the racial discrepancies in attention to postpartum care, coupled with the critical importance of the postpartum period for preventing adverse maternal health outcomes, research is warranted to explore how mobile health (mHealth) applications may help to alleviate maternal health disparities by optimizing postpartum care and addressing barriers to care for postpartum Black women. Thus, this review examines the perceptions of mHealth applications and their utility in health outcomes among postpartum Black women. Methods. We undertook a comprehensive literature search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We included peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2022 that were written in English, utilized mHealth as a primary intervention, and focused on postpartum health and access to resources, primarily among Black women in the United States. Results. A total of eight articles were included in our synthesis, encompassing mobile phone-based interventions for Black women. Cultural tailoring was included in five studies. Interventions that incorporated tailored content and fostered interactions reported high rates of follow-up. Conclusions. Tailored mHealth interventions can effectively promote behavior change and improve health care outcomes for Black women. However, there is a critical need for more research to assess user engagement and retention and whether these improvements indicate long-term sustainability.",

Brief, US-based English-language online messages were gathered from searchable media platforms, a process that yielded 112 anti-SSB videos and 29 pro-SSB commercials. Using a combination of inductive and deductive methods, a content analysis of those messages was conducted to identify their properties. They were coded for the direction (pro vs. anti), target of the advocacy (e.g., consumption vs. policy), actor demographics (gender, age, and ethnicity), persuasive theme (e.g., excessive sugar, nurturing), and message sensation value. Anti-SSB appeals primarily targeted individual-level consumption behavior. They utilized six persuasive themes and often included more than one theme in a single message. Pro-SSB messages used feel-good themes and utilized only one theme per message. The proportions of adults, adolescents, and children differed by the direction of the advocacy. Black, Hispanic, and Asian actors were under-represented in the anti-SSB sample relative to Whites. Pro-SSB appeals were slightly higher than anti-SSB appeals in message sensation value (p = 0.09). The findings illuminate the message features that characterize the universe of brief anti-SSB appeals available online, highlight messaging disparities, and reveal the absence of certain common, effective persuasive themes.",

        "abstract": "\n Our paper seeks to bridge the gap between a linguistic and a technological description of Artificial Intelligence, as we see chatbots and other representations pushing to the forefront of academic ways of working. We set out to venture a philologist’s perspective on AI, critically reflecting upon the extent and nature of a lexicographical software’s ‘intelligence.’ We shall discuss and demonstrate AI’s potentials and limitations by adhering to the specific case of the recently released English Dialect Dictionary Online 4.0 (Markus and team 2023). While we propose that EDD Online is ‘intelligent’ in the sense that its retrieval software will anticipate and be capable of answering many of the questions that dialectologists would raise, we claim that the reason for such ‘intelligence’ is inherently rooted within the competence of humans in terms of predicting such questions and of eliciting the answers by means of complex query rules. We shall in fact argue that – as opposed to retrieval software types like the hotly debated ChatGPT chatbot, which are merely black box phenomena – EDD Online 4.0’s user interface represents a rare feature of AI: transparency and proactive user-friendliness.

        "abstract": "Background: Perceptions of the US healthcare system can impact individuals’ healthcare utilization, including vaccination intentions. This study examined the association between perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This study used data from REACH-US, a nationally representative online survey of a large, diverse sample of U.S. adults (N=5145 January 26, 2021-March 3, 2021). Confirmatory factor and regression analyses examined a latent factor of perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare, whether the factor was associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and whether associations varied across racial–ethnic groups reported as probit estimates (B) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were highest among Black/African American adults (mean latent factor score: 0.65 ± 0.43) and lowest among White adults (mean latent factor score: 0.04 ± 0.67). Black/African American (B = −0.08; 95% CI = −0.19, 0.03) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (B = −0.08; 95% CI = −0.23, 0.07) adults who perceived greater racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were less willing than participants who perceived lower inequities. In contrast, American Indian/Alaska Native (B = 0.15; 95% CI = −0.01, 0.30), Asian (B = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.31), Hispanic/Latino (English language preference) (B = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.43), Multiracial (B = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.36), and White (B = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.43) adults who perceived greater racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were more willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than participants perceiving higher inequities. Conclusions: Greater perceived racial–ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were associated with less willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Black/African American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adults.",

        "title": "Associations of Increased WIC Benefits for Fruits and Vegetables With Food Security and Satisfaction by Race and Ethnicity",
        "abstract": "Introduction The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides nutrition support for racially and ethnically diverse populations. In 2021, the monthly cash value benefit (CVB) for the purchase of fruits and vegetables increased from $9 to $35 and was later adjusted to $24. This study investigated, by racial and ethnic groups, whether CVB increases were associated with increases in CVB redemption, household food security, child fruit and vegetable intake, satisfaction with CVB amount, and likelihood of continued participation in WIC if the CVB returned to $9 per month. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of WIC participants (N = 1,770) in southern California at 3 time points, from April 2021 through May 2022; the CVB amount was $9 at baseline, $35 at Survey 2, and $24 at Survey 3. Racial and ethnic groups were Hispanic English-speakers, Hispanic Spanish-speakers, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Other, and non-Hispanic White. We used mixed-effect and modified Poisson regressions to evaluate outcomes by group. Results At baseline, groups differed significantly in dollars of CVB redeemed, percentage of CVB redeemed, household food security, and satisfaction with CVB amount. After the increase in CVB, we found increases in all groups in CVB redemption, household food security, and satisfaction. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic English-speaking groups, who had low levels of satisfaction at baseline, had larger increases in satisfaction than other groups. Reported likelihood of continued WIC participation if the monthly CVB returned to $9 also differed significantly by group, ranging from 62.5% to 90.0%. Conclusion The increase in CVB for children receiving WIC benefited all racial and ethnic groups. Continued investment in an augmented CVB could improve health outcomes for a racially and ethnically diverse WIC population.",

        "title": "How patients experience respect in healthcare: findings from a qualitative study among multicultural women living with HIV",
        "abstract": "Background Respect is essential to providing high quality healthcare, particularly for groups that are historically marginalized and stigmatized. While ethical principles taught to health professionals focus on patient autonomy as the object of respect for persons, limited studies explore patients’ views of respect. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of a multiculturally diverse group of low-income women living with HIV (WLH) regarding their experience of respect from their medical physicians. Methods We analyzed 57 semi-structured interviews conducted at HIV case management sites in South Florida as part of a larger qualitative study that explored practices facilitating retention and adherence in care. Women were eligible to participate if they identified as African American ( n  = 28), Hispanic/Latina ( n  = 22), or Haitian ( n  = 7). They were asked to describe instances when they were treated with respect by their medical physicians. Interviews were conducted by a fluent research interviewer in either English, Spanish, or Haitian Creole, depending on participant’s language preference. Transcripts were translated, back-translated and reviewed in entirety for any statements or comments about “respect.” After independent coding by 3 investigators, we used a consensual thematic analysis approach to determine themes. Results Results from this study grouped into two overarching classifications: respect manifested in physicians’ orientation towards the patient (i.e., interpersonal behaviors in interactions) and respect in medical professionalism (i.e., clinic procedures and practices). Four main themes emerged regarding respect in provider’s orientation towards the patient: being treated as a person, treated as an equal, treated without blame or prejudice, and treated with concern/emotional support. Two main themes emerged regarding respect as evidenced in medical professionalism: physician availability and considerations of privacy. Conclusions Findings suggest a more robust conception of what ‘respect for persons’ entails in medical ethics for a diverse group of low-income women living with HIV. Findings have implications for broadening areas of focus of future bioethics education, training, and research to include components of interpersonal relationship development, communication, and clinic procedures. We suggest these areas of training may increase respectful medical care experiences and potentially serve to influence persistent and known social and structural determinants of health through provider interactions and health care delivery.",

        "abstract": "Depression has robust natural language correlates and can increasingly be measured in language using predictive models. However, despite evidence that language use varies as a function of individual demographic features (e.g., age, gender), previous work has not systematically examined whether and how depression’s association with language varies by race. We examine how race moderates the relationship between language features (i.e., first-person pronouns and negative emotions) from social media posts and self-reported depression, in a matched sample of Black and White English speakers in the United States. Our findings reveal moderating effects of race: While depression severity predicts I-usage in White individuals, it does not in Black individuals. White individuals use more belongingness and self-deprecation-related negative emotions. Machine learning models trained on similar amounts of data to predict depression severity performed poorly when tested on Black individuals, even when they were trained exclusively using the language of Black individuals. In contrast, analogous models tested on White individuals performed relatively well. Our study reveals surprising race-based differences in the expression of depression in natural language and highlights the need to understand these effects better, especially before language-based models for detecting psychological phenomena are integrated into clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "In 1957 Abbott and Ballentine described a highly toxic activity from a dinoflagellate isolated from the English Channel. in 1949 by Mary Park. From a culture maintained at Plymouth Laboratory since 1950, we have been able to isolate two toxic molecules (Abbotoxin and 59-E-Chloro-Abbotoxin), determine the planar structures by analysis of HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectra and found them to be karlotoxin (KmTx) congeners. Both toxins kill larval zebrafish with symptoms identical to that described by Abbot and Ballantine for gobies (Gobius virescens). Using surface plasma resonance the sterol binding specificity of karlotoxins is shown to require desmethyl sterols. Our results with black lipid membranes indicate that karlotoxin forms large-conductance channels in the lipid membrane, which are characterized by large ionic conductance, poor ionic selectivity, and a complex gating behavior that exhibits strong voltage dependence and multiple gating patterns. In addition, we show that KmTx 2 pore formation is a highly targeted mechanism involving sterol-specificity. This is the first report of the functional properties of the membrane pores formed by karlotoxins and are consistent with the intial observations of Abbott and Ballentine from 1957.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAdherence to oral endocrine therapy (ET) remains an issue for up to half of women prescribed these medications. There is emerging data that Black breast cancer survivors (BCS) have lower rates of ET adherence. Given the disparities in breast cancer recurrence and survival for Black BCS compared to their White counterparts, the goal of this study is to better understand barriers to ET adherence among Black BCS from the patient and provider perspectives.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews between October 29, 2021, and March 1, 2023. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and coded data were organized into primary and secondary themes. Participants were recruited from a single academic cancer center. A convenience sample of 24 Black BCS and 9 medical oncology providers was included. Eligible BCS were 18 years or older, English-speaking, diagnosed with stage I-III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who had initiated ET.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean age of the BCS was 55 years (interquartile range, IQR 17 years). About one-fourth had a high school diploma or less (26.1%) and 47% completed a college education or higher. Approximately one-third of participants had annual household incomes of $40,000 or less (30.4%) or more than $100,000 (30.4%). Forty-three percent of the patient participants had private insurance; 11% were insured through Medicaid or the federal healthcare exchange; 26.1% had Medicare; and 13% were uninsured. Of the 9 medical oncology providers interviewed, 2 were advanced practice providers, and 7 were medical oncologists. We found 3 major themes: (1) Black BCS often had concerns about ET before initiation; (2) after initiation, both BCS and providers reported side effects as the most impactful barrier to ET adherence; and (3) survivors experienced challenges with managing ET side effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that multifaceted support interventions for managing ET-related symptoms may lead to improved adherence to ET among Black women and may reduce disparities in outcomes.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS\nMultifaceted support interventions for managing ET-related symptoms may lead to improved adherence to ET among Black breast cancer survivors.",

        "abstract": "Since its release, the Netflix show, Bridgerton, has been a hit series among its mass audiences as it harnesses an average of 103,550,000 views per season and currently holds fourth place in Netflix’s most popular English-language series (Tudum, 2024). The show has gained immense popularity not only because of its captivating plotlines but also because of the diverse cast of characters placed within the Regency Era. From this, it is critical to dissect and understand how race is represented within the show to discern the discourses being perpetuated to its viewers. Throughout this essay, I will employ Stuart Hall’s theory of representation and the politics of signification to unpack the racial representation within the Netflix show, Bridgerton, and how it reproduces colour-blind casting, interracial relationships, and dark versus light symbolism to perpetuate post-racial and Orientalist discourses. This analysis explores how colour-blind casting sustains post-racial discourses in the disguise of escapist media, which strips the Other of their lived experience. Moreover, it highlights how the depiction of interracial relationships within the show contributes to both post-racial and Orientalist discourses by placing the Occident over the Orient, and disregarding the prejudice often faced by interracial couples during that period. It further reveals how dark versus light symbolism is embedded throughout the interactions between multiple characters, which elicits the disruption of the white imaginary by Black individuals. As the show progresses and continues to release seasons that reach such large audiences, it is crucial to analyze what discourses surrounding race are being perpetuated and its potential impact on reinforcing stereotypes and misrepresenting marginalized communities.",

        "abstract": "Local periodicals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were studied. and local history literature from the funds of the State Archive of the Mykolaiv Region, the National Library of Ukraine named after V. I. Vernadskyi, the Odesa National Scientific Library, and the Mykolaiv Regional Universal Scientific Library to find out the history of the beginning of the game of football in Mykolaiv. In the shipbuilding city of Mykolaiv, which was previously closed to foreigners, where the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Empire was located, the possibility of commercial ships entering began in 1862, when the Commercial Port was opened with permission for the entry of foreign ships to visit and stay in the city of foreigners. Mykolaiv became one of the important ports for grain trade, where many foreign representative offices and banks were opened, commercial shipbuilding began to develop, and the cultural life of the city intensified. According to later local studies, it was established that, based on the memories of contemporaries, the first football meetings in Mykolaiv were started at the end of the 19th century. foreign sailors of merchant ships. Having adopted football traditions from foreigners, in 1901–1902 the teams of the city gymnasium and real school played football, and from 1906, the teams of the mechanical and technical school. At this time, street and district city football teams are created. Despite the fact that the first friendly meetings of football teams took place at the end of the 19th century, reports about the matches appeared in the local press only at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908, Charles Bate, an employee of the bread office, organized the \"Zebra\" team, which played with foreigners and teams from educational institutions and sports clubs both in Mykolaiv and Odesa. Football matches took place on adapted sites, first near the Commercial Port, and later in different areas of the city. The referees of the matches were elected collegially from representatives of both opposing teams. Football matches were played according to English rules. The game of football at the time of its coverage in the local press was popular among the townspeople, especially among the youth of educational institutions, intelligentsia, and port workers. Newspaper articles cite examples of the presence of a significant number of spectators and fans, in connection with which the police had to be called in to maintain order. Local periodicals published not only announcements about scheduled meetings of football teams, notes with analysis of matches and their results, but also training schedules and sportsmen's runs around the city. Press publications announcing scheduled meetings, emotions from matches, the opportunity to observe and participate in joint training with popular athletes in the city contributed to the spread of football in the city. Most often, notes about football matches were printed by the \"Nikolaevskaya newspaper\", popular among the townspeople, with which a sports journalist probably cooperated, who did not indicate his surname or sign his authorship with the cryptonym Z-a.",

        "title": "Population Size Estimation of Men Who Have Sex With Men in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Google Trends Analysis",
        "abstract": "Abstract Background Population size estimation (PSE) for key populations is needed to inform HIV programming and policy. Objective This study aimed to examine the utility of applying a recently proposed method using Google Trend (GT) internet search data to generate PSE (Google Trends Population Size Estimate [GTPSE]) for men who have sex with men (MSM) in 54 countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Methods We examined GT relative search volumes (representing the relative internet search frequency of specific search terms) for “porn” and, as a comparator term, “gay porn” for the year 2020. We assumed “porn” represents “men” (denominator) while “gay porn” represents a subset of “MSM” (numerator) in each county, resulting in a proportional size estimate for MSM. We multiplied the proportional GTPSE values with the countries’ male adult population (15‐49 years) to obtain absolute size estimates. Separately, we produced subnational MSM PSE limited to countries’ (commercial) capitals. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the effect of countries’ levels of urbanization, internet penetration, criminalization of homosexuality, and stigma on national GTPSE results. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in a subset of countries (n=14) examining the effect of alternative English search terms, different language search terms (Spanish, French, and Swahili), and alternative search years (2019 and 2021). Results One country was excluded from our analysis as no GT data could be obtained. Of the remaining 53 countries, all national GTPSE values exceeded the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum PSE threshold of 1% (range 1.2%‐7.5%). For 44 out of 49 (89.8%) of the countries, GTPSE results were higher than Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Key Population Atlas values but largely consistent with the regional UNAIDS Global AIDS Monitoring results. Substantial heterogeneity across same-region countries was evident in GTPSE although smaller than those based on Key Population Atlas data. Subnational GTPSE values were obtained in 51 out of 53 (96%) countries; all subnational GTPSE values exceeded 1% but often did not match or exceed the corresponding countries’ national estimates. None of the covariates examined had a substantial effect on the GTPSE values (R2 values 0.01‐0.28). Alternative (English) search terms in 12 out of 14 (85%) countries produced GTPSE>1%. Using non-English language terms often produced markedly lower same-country GTPSE values compared with English with 10 out of 14 (71%) countries showing national GTPSE exceeding 1%. GTPSE used search data from 2019 and 2021, yielding results similar to those of the reference year 2020. Due to a lack of absolute search volume data, credibility intervals could not be computed. The validity of key assumptions, especially who (males and females) searches for porn and gay porn, could not be assessed. Conclusions GTPSE for MSM provides a simple, fast, essentially cost-free method. Limitations that impact the certainty of our estimates include a lack of validation of key assumptions and an inability to assign credibility intervals. GTPSE for MSM may provide an additional data source, especially for estimating national-level PSE.",

        "abstract": "Sociolinguistic research has demonstrated that ‘urban contact dialects’ tend to diffuse beyond the speech communities in which they first emerge. However, no research has attempted to explore the distribution of these varieties across an entire nation nor isolate the social mechanisms that propel their spread. In this paper, we use a corpus of 1.8 billion geo‐tagged tweets to explore the spread of Multicultural London English (MLE) lexis across the United Kingdom. We find evidence for the diffusion of MLE lexis from East and North London into other ethnically and culturally diverse urban centres across England, particularly those in the South (e.g. Luton), but find lower frequencies of MLE lexis in the North of England (e.g. Manchester), and in Scotland and Wales. Concluding, we emphasise the role of demographic similarity in the diffusion of linguistic innovations by demonstrating that this variety originated in London and diffused into other urban areas in England through the social networks of Black and Asian users.",

        "abstract": "The article examines the problem of inadequate sanitary condition of the English capital in the 14th century and the attempts taken by official authorities – royal and municipal – to solve it, incl. against the backdrop of a plague epidemic. Based on the royal orders addressed to the London magistrate and the data from research literature, the author identifies and characterizes the main steps of the Crown and City administrations aimed at correcting the situation, considering, in particular, the history of the creation of two new cemeteries: East and West Smithfield and some controversial issues associated with it, for example, the problem of the authorship of the project, its implementation and the degree of the government’s participation in that. Estimates of the number, age and gender composition of the victims of the Black Death buried here are also provided. The results of the investigation lead the author to the conclusion that, despite its obvious significance, the issue of the neglected sanitary condition of London did not receive a comprehensive solution in the century under review, since it became relevant only if a critical level risked being reached, when, due to objective reasons, it could no longer be ignored. This also determined the impossibility of developing those few measures taken into a full-fledged state policy. At the same time, the need for changes in the field of municipal hygiene, aggravated by the epidemic, contributed to the intensification of public initiative, supported or directed by the monarch. Thus, a new impetus was given to the dialogue between the royal and municipal authorities in the development and implementation of a unified sanitation policy. In addition, addressing the topic under consideration is of great practical importance for reconstructing the picture of the daily life of a medieval city in an emergency and its preparedness for such trials making it possible to clarify the scale of the Black Death in London.",

        "abstract": "Polandball, or Countryballs, are online user-generated comics about geopolitical satire, with countries personified in spherical characters. One of the most important aspects of Countryball memes is the non-standard English, or Engrish, used in the conversations between characters. This research delves into the Engrish phenomena by collecting and qualitatively examining 200+ comics in the subreddit r/polandball, proposing plausible causes of the phenomena, and raising concerns regarding the implications of the exhibited linguistic stereotypes. The investigation figures out that the language choice in Polandball comics on Reddit generally ranged between serious cultural misunderstanding and code-switching of English with another language. It is concluded that the linguistic stylizations of non-standard English in Polandball comics might be rooted in certain cultural and racial stereotypes and might further reinforce these biased cross-cultural perceptions. The research shed light on the long-ignored African-American Vernacular English appropriation in Polandball comics, and extensively enumerated and identified the most recent Engrish stylizations in Polandball comics.",

The way in which the play represents the tensions between inside and outside is however particularly provocative.

        "abstract": "Birutė Marija Alseikaitė-Gimbutienė (English Marija Gimbutas), is one of the most prominent and well-known archaeologists of the 20th century, pioneer of archaeomythology, creator of new theories in archaeology. In her scientific research, she paid a great attention to the ethnic origins and development of nations.This article analyzes the Theory of Baltic Ethnic Origins formulated by Gimbutas. The solution to this important scientific problem involves two main research stages. The first stage is formulation of the Theory of Indo-European homeland, named the Kurgans Theory. The second stage is formulation of the Theory of the origins of Balts. According to Gimbutas, a few cultural systems participated in the formation of the Balts: the indoeuropeans and substrat culture, that is Indo-Europeanized people of Central Europe. The Indo-Europeans migrated from their homeland, located in the steppe zone north of the Black and Caspian seas, in three waves between 4400/4200 and 3000/2800 BC, ultimately reaching Europe and Indo-Europeanizing it.A secondary Indo-European Homeland was formed in Central Europe, from which the Indo-European culture spread to the Baltic region and other European regions.The last, third wave of newcomers, from around 3000–2800 BC, had the greatest influence on the southeastern and eastern Baltic region and the surrounding territories. During several centuries of assimilation between local inhabitants and newcomers, around 2500–2000 BC, in the territory between the Vistula River in the west and the Volga and Oka rivers in the east, several cultural groups of Proto-Balts were formed. During further ethnocultural processes, around 2000 BC. the Baltic ethnos was formed. In the 2nd and 1st millennium BC. and in the first part of the 1st millennium AD the Balts inhabited a huge area in the North Eastern part of Europe.",

We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on disease burden and correlates in trans adolescents and adults over a 20-month period to identify knowledge gaps and assess methodological characteristics including measurement of gender identity, community engagement, and study quality. Data sources, eligibility criteria, and synthesis methods We searched seven databases using terms related to (a) transgender populations and (b) health or disease. Eligible studies were in English, French, or Spanish and reported original quantitative data on mental health or substance use conditions, infectious diseases, or non-communicable conditions in at least 25 trans individuals aged 15+. Quality assessment was performed in duplicate on a 10% sample of articles and findings were summarized using narrative synthesis. Results The 328 included studies were conducted in 45 countries, with most from North America (54%) and limited research from South Asia (3%), Sub-Saharan Africa (3%), and the Middle East and North Africa (2%). Most studies used cross-sectional designs (73%) and convenience sampling (65%). Only 30% of studies reported any form of community engagement. Mental health and substance use disorders were the most studied area (77% of studies) and non-communicable conditions the least (16%). Available data indicated that trans populations experience high disease burden with considerable heterogeneity within and across settings. Of 39 articles assessed for quality, 80% were rated as fair, 18% as poor, and 3% as good quality. Conclusions and implications Geographic, gender-specific, and topical gaps remain in trans health, but we found more research from African countries, with transmasculine people, and on non-communicable conditions than previous syntheses. Areas for growth in trans health research include community engagement, non-binary health, chronic and age-related conditions, and health determinants. Registration PROSPERO CRD42021234043.",

        "abstract": "Travelling mostly involves expenditure on products beyond daily consumables (i.e. tourism shopping), but sometimes tourists visit a country with the specific intention of acquiring goods unique to that particular context, either for personal or commercial use. This type of “shopping tourism” contributes to the growth of luxury markets such as the exotic leather industry. In stimulating shopping tourism and promoting the local exotic leather industry, it is crucial to understand tourists’ underlying perceptions and sustainable values that influence their luxury shopping behaviour. Using animal skins to create fashion accessories involves several environmental concerns and remains controversial among American and Chinese consumers, who rank among the world’s top luxury goods spenders. This research, therefore, investigated American and Chinese shopping tourists’ luxury value perceptions, sustainability excellence perceptions, and purchase intent for South African exotic leather products. Data was derived from a purposive sample including both American and Chinese tourists, aged 25 years and older, who had either visited South Africa in the past or intended to visit the country soon. A structured online questionnaire consisting of scales adapted from prior empirical research was developed. The English version of the questionnaire was translated into Mandarin and Cantonese for Chinese tourists. Data analysis involved two structural equation models (one based on the American and another on the Chinese tourists’ responses) to test hierarchical relationships among variables. The results confirm that personal luxury value strongly influences sustainability excellence and the purchase intent of exotic leather products for both American and Chinese respondents. These findings highlight the potential of positioning South Africa as a luxury shopping tourism destination for exotic leather products, thus contributing toward economic growth and employment opportunities. However, environmental concerns must be addressed to conform to Eastern and Western tourists' sustainable luxury value perceptions.",

        "abstract": "\n\n\nImplementing effective, affordable and ethical conservation management will be crucial for minimising future biodiversity losses. Such management requires reliable foundational evidence to help managers make informed choices about how to address the needs of their target species. Unfortunately, such evidence is still lacking for many species and management scenarios.\n\nOne major global challenge is improving the reproductive success of threatened species in the context of predation. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of in situ experiments that used non‐lethal methods to protect bird nests against predators, with the aims of summarising global trends in nest protection efforts, comparing the effectiveness of different protection measures and informing future research and management. We considered peer‐reviewed studies in English.\n\nWe detected a large geographic and taxonomic bias in the evidence base with 58% of articles conducted in North America and 76% on ground‐nesting birds. Less than 3% of articles involved taxa listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered and 51% of study units lasted just a single breeding season.\n\nNests protected with exclosures, fences and guards were more likely to be successful than their unprotected controls. Interventions involving deterrents, conditioned taste aversion, chemical camouflage and diversionary feeding did not have a significant positive effect on nest success, but the interventions in these categories were less common and more diverse in nature.\n\nSynthesis and applications. To increase their conservation value, future non‐lethal nest protection experiments should whenever possible clearly state overall aims, take place over multiple seasons, use a comparable control and test non‐lethal protection methods independently of lethal predator control. Greater focus is required on under‐studied taxa such as cup‐nesting songbirds and birds in South America, Africa and Asia, and novel protection techniques such as deterrents and chemical camouflage. Practitioners should consider the evidence we synthesise here when deciding whether non‐lethal nest protection approaches are optimal for their study system, to increase conservation success and reduce ethical and financial costs.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Purpose Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. Methods The search was conducted for journals that published articles in the English language, peer-reviewed, meeting the following criteria: a) randomized clinical trials, b) randomized studies in animals or humans, c) in vitro studies, d) studies using hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides, d) studies assessing alterations on fibroblasts as primary or secondary outcome. We utilized the main journal databases PUBMED/WEB OF SCIENCE and ongoing reviews by PROSPERO. For bias risk and methodological quality, we used an adaptation of the Downs and Black checklist. Our review followed the PRISMA checklist, conducted from February 2024 to the first week of March 2024, by two independent researchers (P.A.Q.I. and R.P.V.). Results Eleven studies were included in this review, where our findings reinforce the notion that hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides at concentrations of 50-500 μg/ml are sufficient to stimulate fibroblasts in human and animal tissues without inducing toxicity. Different enzymatic processes may confer distinct biological properties to collagens, allowing for scenarios favoring fibroblast promotion or antioxidant effects. Lastly, collagens with lower molecular weights exhibit greater bioavailability to adjacent tissues. Conclusion Hydrolyzed collagens or collagen peptides with molecular sizes ranging from <3 - 3000 KDa promote the stimulation of fibroblasts in human tissues.",

        "title": "The importance of community resources for breastfeeding",
        "abstract": "Background Breastfeeding has long-lasting effects on children’s cognition, behavioral, mental and physical health. Previous research shows parental characteristics (e.g., education, race/ethnicity, income level) are associated with breastfeeding initiation and duration. Further, research shows significant variation in access to community resources by race/ethnicity. It is unclear how community resources may impact breastfeeding practices and how this might intersect with maternal race/ethnicity. Methods This study combined nationally-representative data from the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting Infant Care (SAFE), which surveyed US mothers immediately after the infant’s birth and at two to six months of infant age, with the Child Opportunity Index (COI) 2.0, a census tract measure of community resources associated with child development, to explore the association between community resources and breastfeeding initiation and whether this varies based on maternal race/ethnicity and country of birth. The SAFE Study used a stratified, two-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers of infants, while oversampling Hispanic and non-Hispanic (NH) Black mothers. The SAFE study enrolled mothers who spoke English or Spanish across 32 US birth hospitals between January 2011 and March 2014. Results After accounting for individual characteristics, mothers residing in the highest-resourced communities (compared to the lowest) had significantly greater likelihood of breastfeeding. Representation in higher-resourced communities differed by race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity did not significantly moderate the association between community resources and breastfeeding. In examining within race/ethnic groups, however, community resources were not associated with non-US born Black and Hispanic mothers’ rates of breastfeeding, while they were with US born Black and Hispanic mothers. Conclusions Findings suggest that even health behaviors like breastfeeding, which we often associate with individual choice, are connected to the community resources within which they are made. Study implications point to the importance of considering the impact of the contextual factors that shape health and as a potential contributor to understanding the observed race/ethnicity gap.",

Its specific goal is to investigate the occurrence of code-switching between Standard English (SE) and African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the singer's lyrics within different music domains. So, we analyzed the frequency of five AAVE syntactic structures in different music genres - hip hop and rap - in distinct phases of her career. The results show an overall decrease of SE forms and an increase in the use of AAVE forms, though the singer continues to practice code-switching in her songwriting.

        "abstract": "Background The number of older adults entering opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing. However, the lived experiences of aging in OTPs have not been examined. Objective To explore the aging experience with OUD and barriers to medical care for older adults who receive care in OTPs. Design From November 2021 to July 2022, we conducted 1-to-1, semi-structured qualitative interviews in English and Spanish, audio-recorded, transcribed, systematically coded, and analyzed to identify key themes regarding the challenges of aging with OUD and managing chronic diseases. Participants Thirty-six adults aged ≥ 55 enrolled in OTPs in San Diego, California. Approach A descriptive qualitative approach was used. Major themes and subthemes were identified through thematic analysis until thematic saturation was reached. Key Results All participants were on methadone and had a mean age of 63.4 (SD 5.1) years; 11 (30.6%) identified as female, 14 (39%) as Hispanic/Latino, and 11 (36%) as Black, with a mean duration of methadone treatment of 5.6 years. Chronic diseases were common, with 21 (58.3%) reporting hypertension, 9 (25%) reporting untreated hepatitis C, and 32 (88.9%) having ≥ 2 chronic diseases. Three major themes emerged: (1) avoidance of medical care due to multiple intersectional stigmas, including those related to drug use, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, ageism, and housing insecurity; (2) increasing isolation with aging and loss of family and peer groups; (3) the urgent need for integrating medical and aging-focused care with OUD treatment in the setting of increasing health and functional challenges. Conclusions Older adults with OUD reported increasing social isolation and declining health while experiencing multilevel stigma and discrimination. The US healthcare system must transform to deliver age-friendly care that integrates evidence-based geriatric models of care incorporated with substance use disorder treatment and addresses the intersectional stigma this population has experienced in healthcare settings.

        "abstract": "Legal secularism and political participation \nABSTRACT: As is well known, the Italian term ‘laicità’ is polysemic and cannot be adequately translated into English. The word ‘secularism’, in fact, only captures certain senses of ‘laicità’. Ultimately, we are dealing with a very complex phenomenon that surely cannot be analyzed with a dichotomic black and white concept. In this paper we are mainly interested in highlighting legal secularism, understood as neutrality. However, we must pay attention to the fact that liberal neutrality, understood as mutual tolerance and impartiality of institutions, is a “committed neutrality” which deeply differs from Max Weber’s uncommitted neutrality to which scientists aspire. On the other hand, the ideal of legal secularism comes into harsh conflict with the partisan spirit that characterizes political life. Democracy is not only respect for rules, but must come to terms with the citizens’ variegated senses of belonging to this or that community. As they say: “My country, right or wrong”. Precisely because of these limits to rational discourse, we believe that legal secularism, in a broad sense, is not fully achievable even in an open society. \nSOMMARIO: 1.

        "abstract": "In 2016 the English Supreme Court changed the law concerning joint enterprise liablity ub R v Jogee. The decision appeared to provide a remedy for secondary parties that had been convicted under the, albeit faithful application of the old law. The requirement, however, to demonstrate a substantial injustice following the subsequent case of Johnson significantly curtailed the number of appeals based on this change in the law. The substantial injustice test is applied by the English Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) prior to the application of the statutory real possibility test. Up until now, there has not been any research that examines the impact of this situation and the extent that it constricts any remedy for secondary parties convicted under joint enterprise liability.  Using findings from the first study to explore this concept this work examines the limiting effect of the substantial injustice test on the CCRC, explores the application of the corrected law from Jogee, and shows the low number of applicants to the CCRC that identify as black British, despite existing research suggesting this demographic has the highest conviction rate for joint enterprise.",

        "abstract": "We investigated 14 antibiotic residues in 8 marketed freshwater fish species from southeast China and estimated the associated health risks to local consumers. The antibiotic residues were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. Our findings revealed widespread distribution of quinolones (QNs), tetracyclines (TCs), and chloramphenicols (CAPs) in the freshwater fish. Notably, the average concentrations of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin reached levels as high as 62.5 μg/kg wet weight (ww) and 11.7 μg/kg ww, respectively, and detection frequencies were 68.7% for enrofloxacin and 31.6% for ciprofloxacin. Additionally, we detected chloramphenicol, a prohibited antibiotic, in samples with a detection frequency of 0.76%. Among the fish species, the mean concentration of total antibiotic residues was highest in bluntnose black bream (263.3 μg/kg), followed by English perch (52.4 μg/kg), crucian carp (46.3 μg/kg), black carp (28.6 μg/kg), yellowcheek carp (21.0 μg/kg), grass carp (15.3 μg/kg), bighead carp (3.78 μg/kg), and mandarin fish (3.69 μg/kg). We estimated the daily intake values of these antibiotic residues which were lower than the acceptable daily intake values and hazard indexes were much less than 1. It indicates that there is very low direct health risk to consumers. Despite that, investigation on the chronic impact, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria, gut microbiota disruption, and allergic reactions, is urgently needed.",

The study included 384 community-based participants from a province in the Western Black Sea Region of Türkiye. Data was collected via an online form prepared using Google Forms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe index was translated from its original language, English, into Turkish and then retranslated to English by bilingual translators. It was then reviewed and evaluated for possible issues related to translation and degrees of equivalence. When TR-ANU-ADRI-SF levels were compared according to sex, the mean risk scores were found to be 11.25 ± 7.02 for males and 11.69 ± 7.99 for females. After cross-cultural adaptation, the TR-ANU-ADRI-SF was conceptually intelligible to Turkish adults.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe TR-ANU-ADRI-SF is a valid and reliable AD risk assessment tool.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nGiven the increase in AD and its impact on people's health, there is a great need for strategies to be implemented by health professionals to improve the lifestyle of the adult population. For use in conjunction with these strategies, a localised AD risk assessment tool that can be applied by clinicians or by individual patients has been adapted and introduced to the Turkish literature.",

        "abstract": "Background Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are maternity-related increases in blood pressure (eg, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia). Compared with women of other races in high-income countries, Black women have a comparatively higher risk of an HDP. Intersectionality helps to provide a deeper understanding of the multifactorial identities that affect health outcomes in this high-risk population. Objective In this review, we sought to explore the literature on HDP risk factors in Black women living in high-income countries and to assess the interaction of these risk factors using the conceptual framework of intersectionality. Methods We conducted this review using the Arksey and O'Malley methodology with enhancements from Levac and colleagues. Published articles in English on HDP risk factors with a sample of not less than 10% of Black women in high-income countries were included. Six databases, theses, and dissertations were searched from January 2000 to July 2021. A thematic analysis was used to summarize the results. Results A final total of 36 studies were included from the 15 480 studies retrieved; 4 key themes of HDP risks were identified: (1) biological; (2) individual traditional; (3) race and ethnicity, geographical location, and immigration status; and (4) gender related. These intersectional HDP risk factors intersect to increase the risk of HDP among Black women living in high-income countries. Conclusion Upstream approaches are recommended to lower the risks of HDP in this population.",

        "abstract": "Background: Modern penitentiary systems attach great importance, at least in the area of formal and codified arrangements, to providing inmates with access to health care and rehabilitation. The aim of our study was to analyze the Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS medical databases in order to search for and evaluate the available literature discussing the oral status and dental treatment needs of adult male prisoners. Methods: The following terms were used: prisoners or inmates; oral health, oral status; periodontal status, periodontal disease; oral hygiene; caries; mucosa; and saliva. The studies were screened based on their title and abstract according to the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcome) criteria. The research protocol was prepared on the basis of the 2020 PRISMA guidelines and was not registered. The available literature discussing the oral status and dental treatment needs of adult imprisoned patients was analyzed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: articles published in English between 1 January 2012 and 2022; articles discussing the oral cavity status of adult inmates over 18 years old (hard tissues, periodontal status, saliva, mucosa condition, or oral hygiene); articles with a full text available; and articles that were assessed as satisfactory according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: A total of 934 articles were identified, out of which 9 were included in the systematic review. Two articles discussed the oral condition of prisoners in Europe (Russia and Finland), four examined prisoners in Asia (three in India and one in Saudi Arabia), two examined prisoners in Africa (Nigeria), and one examined prisoners in the Americas (Brazil). Conclusions: The oral status of prisoners has been widely discussed in the available literature. Among inmates, a higher frequency of both caries and periodontal disease along with poorer oral hygiene were observed. It can be concluded that inmates should have access to specialized treatment from periodontists and endodontists.",

        "abstract": "A large proportion of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) identify as Black or African American (AA). Social bias and stigma in healthcare outcomes for children with SCD are impossible to explore without considering the impact of racial/cultural identity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geography. It is important to understand the current influences of social movements, expanded health insurance coverage, and telehealth on these variables when considering healthcare outcomes for patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to determine the roles of racial identity, SES, and geography in healthcare outcomes for the pediatric population of children with SCD in the United States (US). This study is a scoping review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases utilized included Cochrane, CINHAL, Medline, and Nursing and Allied Health Collection, all accessed through the EBSCO Information Services. Studies met the following inclusion criteria: published in English, pediatric patients residing in the US, and published between 2017 and 2022. Search terms included “sickle cell” AND “pediatric”, which were then combined with “minority” OR “racial” OR “rural” OR “urban” OR “poverty” OR “income” OR \"socioeconomic status”. The initial search yielded 635 unique articles, with 17 articles meeting full inclusion criteria. Overall, it was clear that there are examples of positive effects of race, low SES, and rural geographic location on positive health outcomes, though a large number of studies oscillated between showing negative associations or no association at all. Barriers to care for patients with SCD are multifaceted, making it difficult to isolate and analyze the impact of individual variables. Many studies demonstrated the significance of family, community, and institutional relationships as positive support for patients with SCD. This review highlights the need for additional research on the healthcare outcome benefits of patient/familial support groups aiming to bring together patients who share racial experience and SCD diagnosis regardless of SES and geography.",

        "abstract": "\n Prior research suggests that bilinguals show reduced sensitivity to negative content when operating in the second language (L2). The available evidence, however, is limited to language comprehension. We tested the production of emotional words in Polish (L1)–English (L2) bilinguals in two EEG studies that manipulated emotional cueing. In Experiment 1 (neutral context), white or black circles indicated whether participants should read aloud (shadow) or translate a subsequently presented word. N400 amplitudes were selectively reduced for negative L2 words regardless of the task. In Experiment 2 (emotional context), we used black or white emojis, either sad or neutral, as cues. The previous interaction between word valence and language of operation vanished, but late positive potential amplitudes elicited by negative words were larger for translation from L2 to L1 (i.e., production in Polish) than L1 to L2. These results validate and extend to production previous findings of attenuated emotional response in L2 comprehension.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to conduct a pest categorisation of Garella musculana (Erschov) (Lepidoptera: Nolidae), following a commodity risk assessment of Juglans regia plants for planting from Türkiye, in which G. musculana was identified as a pest of possible concern to the European Union (EU). Commonly known as the Asian walnut moth, this pest is native to Central Asia and develops on shoots, buds and fruits of Juglans species such as the English walnut, J. regia and the black walnut, J. nigra. Other reported host plants, such as Prunus dulcis and Populus spp., still require confirmation. The pest was first recorded in the EU (Bulgaria) in 2016 and was then reported in Romania in 2018 and Italy in 2021. This moth completes from one to four generations per year depending on environmental conditions (from valley to mountain forests and orchards up to an altitude of 2100 m). Eggs are laid in groups of 2–3 on young nuts or on buds of 1‐year‐old shoots. Neonate larvae usually enter the young nut through the peduncle. After fully exploiting one nut, the larva continues feeding in another one. Development takes 25–40 days. Larvae of the autumn generation do not enter the nuts, and so feed only in the pericarp. Larvae also often feed inside 1‐year‐old shoots or leaf axils. Larvae develop within the host but exit to pupate under loose bark or in deep cracks of bark. The pest overwinters at the larval or pupal stages. Plants for planting, cut branches and infested nuts provide pathways for entry. Climatic conditions and availability of host plants in southern and central EU MSs have allowed this species to establish and spread in Bulgaria, Romania and Italy. Adults can fly and the pest could spread naturally within the EU. Impact on Juglans spp. cultivated for fruit, timber and ornamental purposes is anticipated. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry and further spread of G. musculana. This species meets the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.",

        "abstract": "The nutritive value of mulberry leaves makes it the only food of silkworms (Bombyx mori L.). It is recorded that 6.73 million hectares of area are affected by salinity and sodicity stresses covering various states of the country, which is becoming one of the major threats to popularizing sericulture in India. In the present study, chlorophyll, protein, catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase content of leaves of six mulberry germplasm viz., English Black, Kolitha-3, C776, Rotundiloba, BC259, and S1 grown under coastal saline soils of South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India was investigated. Results demonstrated a sharp decrease in the chlorophyll (2.35 to1.19 mg.g FW-1) and protein (30.10 to 15.20 mg.g FW-1) contents of leaves of all the mulberry germplasm with increasing soil salinity (1.60 to 22.70 dS.m-1). On the contrary, the number of stress-related antioxidant enzymes like catalase, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase increased from 1.15 to 5.43, 1.43 to 4.76, and 8.65 to 25.15 g-1 FW.min-1, respectively. Overall, the field study indicated the superiority of Kolitha-3 and C776 grown in Canning (Canning I and II), Basanti, Namkhana, Kakdwip, and Sagar blocks of coastal regions of South 24 Parganas. The study deals with issues of the utilization of scarce land promoting income-generating avenues like sericulture in saline areas.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: English walnuts are the walnut species of choice for nut production. In the United States, edible English walnuts are almost exclusively produced in California, using soil and water resources on more than 370,000 acres. Scion cultivars of English walnuts are grafted onto rootstocks. Traditional rootstocks are seedling populations of socalled Paradox hybrids generated from crosses of black walnut with English walnut. These rootstocks are susceptible to soil-borne diseases, including crown gall, Phytophthora root and crown rot, and plantparasitic nematodes. Strategies to respond to these diseases include the use of newly developed clonal walnut rootstocks with genetic resistance. In a survey conducted during 2020 through 2021, walnut growers revealed their willingness to pay higher prices for clonal walnut rootstocks with some disease resistance. The survey showed that they were most concerned with crown gall and nematodes, and were willing to pay significant price premiums for rootstocks that are resistant to these pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social group–based identities intersect. The meaning of “woman” is modulated by adding social class as in “rich woman” or “poor woman.” How does such intersectionality operate at-scale in everyday language? Which intersections dominate (are most frequent)? What qualities (positivity, competence, warmth) are ascribed to each intersection? In this study, we make it possible to address such questions by developing a stepwise procedure, Flexible Intersectional Stereotype Extraction (FISE), applied to word embeddings (GloVe; BERT) trained on billions of words of English Internet text, revealing insights into intersectional stereotypes. First, applying FISE to occupation stereotypes across intersections of gender, race, and class showed alignment with ground-truth data on occupation demographics, providing initial validation. Second, applying FISE to trait adjectives showed strong androcentrism (Men) and ethnocentrism (White) in dominating everyday English language (e.g. White + Men are associated with 59% of traits; Black + Women with 5%). Associated traits also revealed intersectional differences: advantaged intersectional groups, especially intersections involving Rich, had more common, positive, warm, competent, and dominant trait associates. Together, the empirical insights from FISE illustrate its utility for transparently and efficiently quantifying intersectional stereotypes in existing large text corpora, with potential to expand intersectionality research across unprecedented time and place. This project further sets up the infrastructure necessary to pursue new research on the emergent properties of intersectional identities.",

        "abstract": "Background Historically, golf does not have a strong tradition of fitness testing and physical training. However, in recent years, both players and practitioners have started to recognise the value of a fitter and healthier body, owing to its potential positive impacts on performance, namely clubhead speed (CHS). Objective The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the associations between CHS (as measured using a driver) and a variety of physical characteristics. Methods A systematic literature search with meta-analysis was conducted using Medline, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and PubMed databases. Inclusion criteria required studies to have (1) determined the association between physical characteristics assessed in at least one physical test and CHS, (2) included golfers of any skill level but they had to be free from injury and (3) been peer-reviewed and published in the English language. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black Quality Index tool and heterogeneity assessed via the Q statistic and I2. To provide summary effects for each of the physical characteristics and their associations with CHS, a random effects model was used where z-transformed r values (i.e. zr) were computed to enable effect size pooling within the meta-analysis. Results Of the 3039 studies initially identified, 20 were included in the final analysis. CHS was significantly associated with lower body strength (zr = 0.47 [95% confidence intervals {CI} 0.24–0.69]), upper body strength (zr = 0.48 [95% CI 0.28–0.68]), jump displacement (zr = 0.53 [95% CI 0.28–0.78]), jump impulse (zr = 0.82 [95% CI 0.63–1.02]), jumping peak power (zr = 0.66 [95% CI 0.53–0.79]), upper body explosive strength (zr = 0.67 [95% CI 0.53–0.80]), anthropometry (zr = 0.43 [95% CI 0.29–0.58]) and muscle capacity (zr = 0.17 [95% CI 0.04–0.31]), but not flexibility (zr = − 0.04 [95% CI − 0.33 to 0.26]) or balance (zr =  − 0.06 [95% CI − 0.46 to 0.34]). Conclusions The findings from this meta-analysis highlight a range of physical characteristics are associated with CHS. Whilst significant associations ranged from trivial to large, noteworthy information is that jump impulse produced the strongest association, upper body explosive strength showed noticeably larger associations than upper body strength, and flexibility was not significant. These findings can be used to ensure practitioners prioritise appropriate fitness testing protocols for golfers.",

        "abstract": "Introduction People living with type 2 diabetes who experience homelessness face a myriad of barriers to engaging in diabetes self-care behaviors that lead to premature complications and death. This is exacerbated by high rates of comorbid mental illness, substance use disorder, and other physical health problems. Despite strong evidence to support lay health coach and behavioral activation, little research has effectively engaged people living with type 2 diabetes who had experienced homelessness (DH). Methods We used community engaged research and incremental behavioral treatment development to design the Diabetes HOmeless MEdication Support (D-HOMES) program, a one-on-one, 3 month, coaching intervention to improve medication adherence and psychological wellness for DH. We present results of our pilot randomized trial (with baseline, 3 mo., 6 mo. assessments) comparing D-HOMES to enhanced usual care (EUC; brief diabetes education session and routine care; NCT05258630). Participants were English-speaking adults with type 2 diabetes, current/recent (<24 mo.) homelessness, and an HbA1c‗7.5%. We focused on feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement) and acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, CSQ-8). Our primary clinical outcome was glycemic control (HbA1c) and primary behavioral outcome was medication adherence. Secondary outcomes included psychological wellness and diabetes self-care. Results Thirty-six eligible participants enrolled, 18 in each arm. Most participants identified as Black males, had high rates of co-morbidities, and lived in subsidized housing. We retained 100% of participants at 3-months, and 94% at 6-months. Participants reported high satisfaction (mean CSQ-8 scores=28.64 [SD 3.94] of 32). HbA1c reduced to clinically significant levels in both groups, but we found no between group differences. Mean blood pressure improved more in D-HOMES than EUC between baseline and 6 mo. with between group mean differences of systolic -19.5 mmHg (p=0.030) and diastolic blood pressure -11.1 mmHg (p=0.049). We found no significant between group differences in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion We effectively recruited and retained DH over 6 months. Data support that the D-HOMES intervention was acceptable and feasible. We observe preliminary blood pressure improvement favoring D-HOMES that were statistically and clinically significant. D-HOMES warrants testing in a fully powered trial which could inform future high quality behavioral trials to promote health equity.

        "title": "A CASE OF SELF-HARM USING A DEVICE TO STUN FARM ANIMALS",
        "abstract": "There are several types of devices used to stun cattle before slaughter or stunner (captive bolt pistol, cattlegun, stunner). This device consists of a heavy impact rod made of corrosion-resistant alloys such as stainless steel. It is held inside the case with the help of rubber washers and does not protrude from it. The rod is actuated by the trigger and is advanced by compressed air, a spring mechanism, or a blank cartridge charge that is ignited by the firing pin. After a shallow but strong blow to the animal's forehead, the spring tension causes the rod to roll back into the housing. In forensic medical practice, such devices usually appear as instruments of death in cases of suicidal or accidental injuries. Moreover, when reviewing the Ukrainian-language literature, the authors did not come across reports of deaths caused by stunners for stunning animals. Such situations are described in English-language professional periodicals, but they are extremely rare. Killings are generally isolated, apparently due to the fact that fatal wounds when fired from these devices occur from a distance of less than 10 cm, which follows from the design, namely the length of the rod. That is why the authors decided to report on a case from their expert work. \nA 58-year-old man was found unconscious in a beam and was taken to the hospital with a severe open penetrating brain injury, a hole-multifragmentary fracture of the left temporal bone, where he died 10 hours later. No additional data was provided by the police \nAccording to the autopsy data, a wound of a slightly irregular, rounded shape, with a diameter of about 0.9 cm, with small scalloped edges, which were unevenly beveled due to the \"minus-tissue\" defect towards the center, was found. Around the wound, there was an irregular, rectangular-shaped, brown-brown, dried-up scab, which was more pronounced on the lower edge. On the bow of the right temporal bone there is a hole-fragmentary fracture with the formation of a bone defect in the central part. The defect had a rounded shape, its edges are finely serrated, beveled like a trapezoid in the direction of the skull cavity, around the defect there is a funnel-shaped depression of the bone, which is formed by three incomplete fragments of an irregular shape. The total length of the wound canal was about 9 cm, and there were small bone fragments in the brain detritus along its entire length. No striking elements of the projectile or the projectile itself were found within the wound channel. \nAccording to the medical criminalistics investigation, the following were found: intermittent overlays of small dust-like dull particles of dark gray and black color, similar to soot shot, within the sedimentation belt, on the walls of the hole, and on the area of an irregular oval shape, located below and to the right of the above-mentioned damage. A diphenylamine test with dust-like particles gave a positive result. Traces of compounds of iron (characteristic form), lead, nickel and copper were also detected by the contact-diffusion method. \nConclusions: \n \nUnfortunately, police very often do not provide important, and sometimes critically important, information, especially before the examination, so it is necessary to request the provision of criminal proceedings materials in any case with undetermined or unspecified circumstances. \nForensic medical experts must use all available verified sources of information, within the framework allowed by legislation of Ukraine. \nIn this case, the injuries were caused by a device with a firearm mechanism of operation, therefore, in unclear cases, it is necessary to use the term \"device\" and not \"weapon\" in the results. \n",

        "abstract": "While homelessness is a global phenomenon, research on homelessness skews heavily towards high-income nations such as those in North America, Europe, and Australia. The academic publishing sector also highly privileges articles written in English. Therefore, homelessness in the global south or non-English as a first language countries is less understood and less recognized. In this article, we explore homelessness as a phenomenon in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. In particular, we use a gender-based analysis to understand the highly gendered nature of homelessness in this region, presenting an argument that while homelessness is gendered globally, in regions where gender inequality is greater, women and gender-diverse people will be more disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Therefore, obtaining Sustainable Development Goal 5 of ‘Gender Equality’ and efforts to prevent homelessness will go hand-in-hand within the MENA region.",

        "abstract": "Background Lack of childcare for children aged 0–3 years has emerged as a global crisis, accentuated by women’s increasing workforce participation and recognition that young children require nurturing care. Through this systematic review, we sought to examine associations between childcare centre attendance in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and children’s health, growth, and development, and to generate childcare centre programmatic and research recommendations for children aged 0–3 years. Methods We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane for articles on centre-based childcare for children aged 0–3 years in LMICs, published between 2000 and 2021 in English (or which were translated into English). We excluded articles on specialised subgroups or interventions. We imported the retrieved articles into Covidence for review and assessed them for bias using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool. Results Twenty-two articles (24 studies) met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 36 927 children from 10 countries across Mexico and South America (n = 12), Africa (n = 5), and Asia (n = 5). Outcomes included health (n = 12), growth/nutrition (n = 6), and development (n = 6). Study quality assessments were low; 41% exceeded 50% of quality criteria and 45% adjusted for confounders. Associations between childcare attendance and outcome measures were primarily negative for health (n/N = 7/12) and positive for growth/nutrition (n/N = 5/6) and development (n/N = 4/6). Childcare centre programmatic recommendations for children aged 0–3 years included: age-specific policies; program quality, including safety, hygiene, nutrition, and curriculum; access and affordability; parent engagement; financial support; and workforce development. Research recommendations included: study design, including enrolment age, frequency, duration, childcare type, home and childcare sociodemographic and cultural environments, child and caregiver outcomes, and analytical approaches; longitudinal studies; and implementation research. Conclusions Rigorous primary research in global childcare for young children is urgently needed. Policies, programmes, and investments in high-quality childcare can promote nurturing care for young children, enabling mothers to participate in the workforce.

        "abstract": "Introduction People with chronic conditions and people with colorectal cancer (CRC) may share common risk factors; thus, CRC screening is important for people with chronic conditions. We examined racial and ethnic differences in the use of CRC screening among people with various numbers of chronic conditions. Methods We included data on adult respondents aged 50 to 75 years from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2012 through 2020. We categorized counts of 9 conditions as 0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4. We classified self-reported CRC screening status as up to date or not. We used Poisson models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) among the different counts of chronic conditions in 4 racial and ethnic groups: Hispanic adults with limited English proficiency (LEP), Hispanic adults without LEP, non-Hispanic Black adults, and non-Hispanic White adults. Results Overall, 66.5% of respondents were up to date with CRC screening. The prevalence of being up to date increased with the number of chronic conditions. We found disparities among racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic respondents with LEP had lower rates than non-Hispanic White adults of being up to date with CRC screening across all counts of chronic conditions (APR for 0 conditions = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.64–0.71; APR for ≥4 conditions = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91). Hispanic respondents without LEP with 0, 1, or 2 conditions were less likely than non-Hispanic White respondents to be up to date with CRC screening. We found no significant differences between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White respondents. Conclusion We found disparities among Hispanic BRFSS respondents with LEP, who had lower rates than non-Hispanic White respondents of being up to date with CRC screening, regardless of the number of chronic conditions. Tailored interventions are needed to address these disparities and improve screening rates, particularly among Hispanic people.",

        "abstract": "Linguistic accommodation refers to the process of adjusting one’s language, speech, or communication style to match or adapt to that of others in a social interaction. It is known to be vital to effective health communication. Despite this evidence, there is little scientific guidance on how to design linguistically adapted health behavior interventions for diverse English-speaking populations. This study aims to document the strategies used to develop a culturally grounded cancer prevention intervention with the capabilities to linguistically accommodate to speakers of African American English (AAE). We describe the iterative process of developing a cancer prevention intervention with contributions of racially and linguistically diverse colleagues representing various community and institutional perspectives, including communication scientists, linguists, a community advisory board, professional voice talents, and institutional representatives for scientific integrity. We offer a detailed description of the successes and, in some cases, failures of strategies. Social stereotypes associated with AAE were prevalent at both institutional and community levels, resulting in unanticipated challenges and delays during intervention development. The diversity of linguistic, racial, and role identities within the message development team was integral to successfully addressing and identifying opportunities for process improvement. Language is a vital but often overlooked aspect of intervention development. Message designers should consider implicit social stereotypes that unintentionally shape linguistic choices. This study provides a novel overview of how various types of expertise and iterative message development processes contribute to successfully navigating cultural grounding when sensitive or stigmatized issues are salient.",

        "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 prompted governments worldwide to enforce lockdowns and social restrictions, alongside the rapid adoption of digital health and care services. However, there are concerns about the potential exclusion of older adults, who face barriers to digital inclusion, such as age, socioeconomic status, literacy level, and ethnicity. Objective This study aims to explore the experiences of older adults from the 3 largest minoritized ethnic groups in England and Wales—people of South Asian, Black African, and Caribbean backgrounds—in the use of digitalized primary care services since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In total, 27 individuals participated in 4 focus groups (April and May 2023) either in person or via online videoconferencing. Patient and public involvement and engagement were sought through collaboration with community organizations for focus group recruitment and feedback on the topic guide. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Results This paper summarizes the perspectives of 27 older adults from these 3 minoritized ethnic groups and identifies four key themes: (1) service accessibility through digital health (participants faced difficulties accessing digital health care services through online platforms, primarily due to language barriers and limited digital skills, with reliance on younger family members or community organizations for assistance; the lack of digital literacy among older community members was a prominent concern, and digital health care services were felt to be tailored for English speakers, with minimal consultation during the development phase), (2) importance of face-to-face (in-person) appointments for patient-clinician interactions (in-person appointments were strongly preferred, emphasizing the value of physical interaction and connection with health care professionals; video consultations were seen as an acceptable alternative), (3) stressors caused by the shift to remote access (the transition to remote digital access caused stress, fear, and anxiety; participants felt that digital health solutions were imposed without sufficient explanation or consent; and Black African and Caribbean participants reported experiences of racial discrimination within the health care system), and (4) digital solutions (evaluating technology acceptance; participants acknowledged the importance of digitalization but cautioned against viewing it as a one-size-fits-all solution; they advocated for offline alternatives and a hybrid approach, emphasizing the need for choice and a well-staffed clinical workforce). Conclusions Digital health initiatives should address the digital divide, health inequalities, and the specific challenges faced by older adults, particularly those from minoritized ethnic backgrounds, ensuring accessibility, choice, and privacy. Overcoming language barriers involves more than mere translation. Maintaining in-person options for consultations, addressing sensitive issues, and implementing support systems at the practice level to support those struggling to access services are vital. This study recommends that policy makers ensure the inclusivity of older adults from diverse backgrounds in the design and implementation of digital health and social care services.",

        "abstract": "PurposeFood literacy is a multidimensional concept that prioritises the aspects individuals require to navigate the contemporary foodscape successfully. The study aims to map the knowledge base and intellectual structure of the concept of food literacy to assess if the most cited definitions reflect these constructs.Design/methodology/approachThe inclusion criteria of full-text, peer-reviewed articles or conference papers, in English, using “food literacy” within the title, abstract, keywords or linked to the research focus produced 538 articles from the Scopus database from its inception until January 31, 2023. Articles were analysed according to exponential growth, geolocations, authors, articles, research areas and keywords using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and Excel.FindingsFood literacy research grew exponentially between 2012 and 2022 at a rate of 50% and spanned 62 research areas, with nutrition and dietetics being the most common. Vidgen and Gallegos were the most cited authors of the most cited article, and Australia was the most influential food literacy research geolocation. Research originating from developing countries within Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America was underrepresented, and COVID-19 impacted research trends between 2020 and 2023.Practical implicationsIt is recommended to link “food literacy” to appropriate publications to increase its visibility and that food literacy be redefined and conceptualised to better reflect its intellectual structure. To complete this task, further research guided by keyword clustering can enhance conceptual understanding.Originality/valueThis study provides new insight into the knowledge base and intellectual structure of food literacy and provides scope for future research to develop the concept further.",

        "title": "Large Language Models for Mental Health Applications: Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial neural networks trained on extensive datasets to accurately understand and generate natural language. While they have received much attention and demonstrated potential in digital health, their application in mental health, particularly in clinical settings, has generated considerable debate. Objective This systematic review aims to critically assess the use of LLMs in mental health, specifically focusing on their applicability and efficacy in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical settings. By systematically collating and assessing the evidence from current studies, our work analyzes models, methodologies, data sources, and outcomes, thereby highlighting the potential of LLMs in mental health, the challenges they present, and the prospects for their clinical use. Methods Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this review searched 5 open-access databases: MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM Digital Library. Keywords used were (mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry) AND (large language models). This study included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, and excluded articles published in languages other than English. Results In total, 40 articles were evaluated, including 15 (38%) articles on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text analysis, 7 (18%) on the use of LLMs as mental health conversational agents, and 18 (45%) on other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health. LLMs show good effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, destigmatized eHealth services. However, assessments also indicate that the current risks associated with clinical use might surpass their benefits. These risks include inconsistencies in generated text; the production of hallucinations; and the absence of a comprehensive, benchmarked ethical framework. Conclusions This systematic review examines the clinical applications of LLMs in mental health, highlighting their potential and inherent risks. The study identifies several issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of generated content, challenges in interpretability due to the “black box” nature of LLMs, and ongoing ethical dilemmas. These ethical concerns include the absence of a clear, benchmarked ethical framework; data privacy issues; and the potential for overreliance on LLMs by both physicians and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practices. As a result, LLMs should not be considered substitutes for professional mental health services. However, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as valuable clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Since our first pediatric anonymous non-directed live donor liver transplant (A-LDLT) performed in April 2005, 62 children have undergone live donor liver transplant (LDLT) with an anonymous non-directed graft. Anon-LDLT organs being allocated as per our deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) wait list. Aims To evaluate clinical outcomes, recipient characteristics and social determinants of health of pediatric recipients of A-LDLT in comparison to those who received a directed LDLT (Dir-LDLT) and DDLT. Methods Retrospective analysis of all recipients of LDLT performed between January 2005 and March 2023. Demographic and clinical data included age, sex, race, ethnicity, single-parent households, primary diagnosis, recipient blood type, time on waiting list, post-LT intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), time to extubation, and post-transplant comorbidities were assessed as covariates. A comparative analysis was conducted between children receiving A-LDLT, Dir-LDLT versus DDLT. Results A total of 422 (50% male, 57% white, 23% Asian, 7% Black, 5% indigenous) childrenunderwent LT during the study period. Biliary atresia (40%) and metabolic diseases (19%) were the commonest primary indications. A-LDLT was done in 62 children (15%) with no directed donor options. Dir-LDLT was in 174 children (41%). Of 186 DDLTs (44%), 25% were split grafts, 26% reduced, and 49% whole liver grafts. In A-LDLT recipients, the primary diseases were more frequently characterized by metabolic disorders (31%), while the incidence of acute liver failure was notably lower (0%). Recipients of Anon-LDLT were more often Indigenous recipients in comparison to Dir-LDLT or DDLT recipients (p=0.044). Anon-LDLT recipients were more frequently living in single parent households (18% vs 3% vs 10%, pampersand:003C0.001) and to require interpreter assistance (11% vs 3% vs 0.5%, pampersand:003C0.001) (Table), compared to children who received Dir-LDLT or DDLT. Median time on the wait list was longer for Anon-LDLT (92 days) compared to Dir-LDLT (62 days) and DDLT (72 days) recipients (p=0.004). Post-LT ICU LOS, time to extubation, other post-LT complications or patient prognosis were better in the A-LDLT and Dir-LDLT recipients than DDLT recipients. Conclusions This retrospective analysis of 422 children undergoing LT at a single institution confirms excellent patient and graft survival for A-LDLT recipients. Patients from Indigenous communities, single parent and households where English is a second language, are more frequently the beneficiaries of Anon-LDLT grafts. Anon-LDLT, as utilized in this single center analysis, benefits medically underserved pediatric patients who otherwise have limited access to the advantages of LT. Funding Agencies None",

        "abstract": "The Black Lives Matter (BLM) social movement has emerged as a prominent challenge to the principles and values of contemporary societies. Concurrently, the practices of cancel culture extend to the historical past as well. The primary objective of this article is to conduct a comparative analysis of forms of historical forgetting and figures of silence within the commemorative practices of BLM, as depicted in media discourses across the English-speaking countries. Making use of the critical discourse analysis methodology of N. Fairclough and S. Jäger, this study analyzes the discursive aspects of monument cancellations and key figures of silence in the media portrayal of BLM commemorative practices in the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia. \nThe research reveals that, despite the unique characteristics of media discourses in Australia and Canada, particularly concerning the memory of indigenous peoples, the canceling practices in the countries examined exhibit similar features. These include general forms of oblivion associated with the formation of a new identity, as outlined by P. Connerton, and the use of forgetting as a weapon, as described by A. Assmann, in the quest for symbolic capital. This study identifies and examines key figures of silence within BLM as a community of memory, including a-historical perspective of colonial era events, disproportionate focus on selected cancellation facts, invocation of collective guilt, silence over morally questionable traits of the oppressed, absence of a constructive program linking past and future, and unchecked emotional expression regarding the past.",

        "abstract": "Passion episodes such as the Buffeting are known for the powerful acts of compassion they occasioned within audiences through their performance of violence on the person of Jesus. Few critics, however, have considered that these episodes depend on antisemitic, Islamophobic, and anti-Black depictions of antagonists when engendering such emotional dispositions. By investigating the dynamics of mockery through a deeper look into the composite identities of Jesus’s antagonists, this study reveals that these plays and the communities that produced them rely on a disingenuous stance of victimhood for their effectiveness. This ‘victim play’—the collaborative community effort to claim the status of victim while simultaneously participating in the victimization of others—obscures that those who are attributed cruel acts of mockery are actually its targets. The powerful rhetorical strategies of the premodern English episodes are thus unearthed in this study.",

        "abstract": "Background Patient engagement with secure messaging (SM) via digital patient portals has been associated with improved diabetes outcomes, including increased patient satisfaction and better glycemic control. Yet, disparities in SM uptake exist among older patients and racial and ethnic underserved groups. Care partners (family members or friends) may provide a means for mitigating these disparities; however, it remains unclear whether and to what extent care partners might enhance SM use. Objective We aim to examine whether SM use differs among older patients with diabetes based on the involvement of care partner proxies. Methods This is a substudy of the ECLIPPSE (Employing Computational Linguistics to Improve Patient-Provider Secure Emails) project, a cohort study taking place in a large, fully integrated health care delivery system with an established digital patient portal serving over 4 million patients. Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥50 years, newly registered on the patient portal, who sent ≥1 English-language message to their clinician between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015. Proxy SM was identified by having a registered proxy. To identify nonregistered proxies, a computational linguistics algorithm was applied to detect words and phrases more likely to appear in proxy messages compared to patient-authored messages. The primary outcome was the annual volume of secure messages (sent or received); secondary outcomes were the length of time to the first SM sent by patient or proxy and the number of annual SM exchanges (unique message topics generating ≥1 reply). Results The mean age of the cohort (N=7659) at this study’s start was 61 (SD 7.16) years; 75% (n=5573) were married, 15% (n=1089) identified as Black, 10% (n=747) Chinese, 12% (n=905) Filipino, 13% (n=999) Latino, and 30% (n=2225) White. Further, 49% (n=3782) of patients used a proxy to some extent. Compared to nonproxy users, proxy users were older (P<.001), had lower educational attainment (P<.001), and had more comorbidities (P<.001). Adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, proxy users had greater annual SM volume (20.7, 95% CI 20.2-21.2 vs 10.9, 95% CI 10.7-11.2; P<.001), shorter time to SM initiation (hazard ratio vs nonusers: 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.37; P<.001), and more annual SM exchanges (6.0, 95% CI 5.8-6.1 vs 2.9, 95% CI 2.9-3.0, P<.001). Differences in SM engagement by proxy status were similar across patient levels of education, and racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions Among a cohort of older patients with diabetes, proxy SM involvement was independently associated with earlier initiation and increased intensity of messaging, although it did not appear to mitigate existing disparities in SM. These findings suggest care partners can enhance patient-clinician telecommunication in diabetes care. Future studies should examine the effect of care partners’ SM involvement on diabetes-related quality of care and clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Hypertension is the leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality throughout the world and is pervasive in United States emergency departments (ED). This study documents the point prevalence of subclinical heart disease in emergency patients with asymptomatic hypertension. Method This was a prospective observational study of ED patients with asymptomatic hypertension conducted at two urban academic EDs that belong to an eight-hospital healthcare organization in New York. Adult (≥18 years of age) English- or Spanish-speaking patients who had an initial blood pressure (BP) ≥160/100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and second BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, and pending discharge, were invited to participate in the study. We excluded patients with congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation, or who were pregnant, a prisoner, cognitively unable to provide informed consent, or experiencing symptoms of hypertension. We assessed echocardiographic evidence of subclinical heart disease (left ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic and systolic dysfunction). Results A total of 53 patients were included in the study; a majority were young (mean 49.5 years old, [SD 14–52]), self-identified as Black or Other (n = 39; 73.5%), and female (n = 30; 56.6%). Mean initial blood pressure was 172/100 mm Hg, and 24 patients (45.3%) self-reported a history of hypertension. Fifty patients completed an echocardiogram. All (100%) had evidence of subclinical heart disease, with 41 (77.4%) displaying left ventricular hypertrophy and 31 (58.5%) diastolic dysfunction. There was a significant relationship between diastolic dysfunction and female gender [x2 (1, n = 53) = 3.98; P = 0.046]; Black or other race [x2 (3, n = 53) = 9.138; P = 0.03] and Hispanic or other ethnicity [x2 (2, n = 53) = 8.03; P = 0.02]. Less than one third of patients demonstrated systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram, and this was more likely to occur in patients with diabetes mellitus [x2 (1, n = 51) = 4.84; P = 0.02]. Conclusion There is a high probability that Black, Hispanic, and female patients with asymptomatic hypertension are on the continuum for developing overt heart failure. Emergency clinicians should provide individualized care that considers their unique health needs, cultural backgrounds, and social determinants of health.",

        "abstract": "Background Prevalence of smoking is high among patients receiving care in safety-net settings, and there is a need to better understand patient factors associated with smoking cessation and receipt of cessation services. Objective To identify patient factors associated with smoking cessation attempts and receipt of cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy in a large safety-net health system. Design We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using EHR data in a safety-net system in San Francisco, CA. Participants We included 7384 adult current smokers who had at least three unique primary care encounters with documented smoking status between August 2019 and April 2022. Main measures We assessed four outcomes using multivariate generalized estimating equation models: (1) any cessation attempt, indicating a transition in smoking status from “current smoker” to “former smoker”; (2) sustained cessation, defined as transition in smoking status from current smoker to former smokers for two or more consecutive visits; (3) receipt of smoking cessation counseling from healthcare providers; and (4) receipt of pharmacotherapy. Key Results Of 7384 current adult smokers, 17.6% had made any cessation attempt, and of those 66.5% had sustained cessation. Most patients (81.1%) received counseling and 41.8% received pharmacotherapy. Factors associated with lower odds of any cessation attempt included being aged 45–64, non-Hispanic black, and experiencing homelessness. The factor associated with lower odds of sustained cessation was being male. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving counseling were being insured by Medicaid or being uninsured. Factors associated with lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy included speaking languages other than English, being male, and identifying as racial and ethnic minorities. Conclusions Health system interventions could close the gap in access to smoking cessation services for unhoused and racial/ethnic minority patients in safety-net settings, thereby increasing cessation among these populations.",
