        "abstract": "This study investigated school principals’ individual and aggregate perceptions of students who use African American Vernacular English in Houston, TX. Using the African American English Teacher Attitude Scale (AAETAS), the study seeks to describe the relationship between principals’ demographic characteristics and their perceptions of African American Vernacular English. The study used raw scores from the AAETAS instrument created by Hoover, McNair-Knox, Lewis and Politzer (1997) and coded the principals’ perceptions of AAVE. Principals’ demographic information was gathered on the following categories: race, gender, age, language and dialect use of subjects, school enrollment, years teaching, years as an administrator, total employment years, and the aggregate mean of all principals’ scores. These categories assist in highlighting perceptions and expectations among demographics. The results show an overall attitude of difference and mild acceptance. Four of the 44 principals (9.1%) had a negative or deficit attitude toward AAVE. Thirty-two principals (72.7%) were in the “Difference” category, meaning that listeners view AAVE as different and not necessarily negative. “Excellence” is a strong positive attitude towards AAVE. Eight out of 44 (18.2%) principals were in this category. Because this is a qualitative study, the principals’ responses have been explained through narrative. About 18% of school principals in this study indicated that the dialect could be harmful to one’s academic career, and they perceived AAVE as a dialect they would prefer students not use.",

I mention my key mentors and influencers, including Roger Keesing, J. Herman Blake, Robert Le Page, and William Labov. And I identify some of the foci of my research over the years, including vowel laxing in Guyanese personal pronouns, prior creolization in the history of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), the Ebonics controversy, stylistic variation in sociolinguistics, quotative all, and racial disparities in automated speech recognition. Finally, I focus on “Activist Sociolinguistics,” including fighting for increased success for AAVE and other vernacular speakers in schools and for increased justice for them in the courtroom.",

        "abstract": "In the field of ethnolect study, African American Vernacular English and Chicano English are known for their great significance in indexing and building identities. The Chicago and Chicago Northwest Suburb communities in particular, however, have seen little methodological linguistic study with concern to language attitudes. The following work is an analysis of interviews that took place in the Chicago area with members of the African American community. Although research on language attitudes in minority communities has already been carried out,1 not much has been done as far as language attitude research within the African American community in Chicago. The interviews regarded the attitudes of in-group members to their respective ethnolects and provides an analysis of aspects of their perceptions concerning the varieties associated with their ethnic group. The interviews followed the direct approach to language attitude studies and consisted of open questions.2 In order to elicit responses from each speaker concerning the varieties they speak, questions of discrimination, attitudes, and perception, especially in the context of employment, were touched upon in the conversations with each participant. 1 M.

        "abstract": "The phrase 'Not in my backyard' abbreviated to NIMBY is commonly used to refer to the stiff opjwsition which local citizens mount to prevent individuals or institutions that they consider undesirable from moving into their communities. Linguists sometimes seem to have a NIMBY attitude towards Applied Linguistics issues and the Great Language Debates of our Times, motivated perhaps by the fear that they will distract us from the theoretical and descriptive research we consider our bread and butter (if not our fame and fortune), that they will devour our time and dilute our expertise, or that they will lead us into uncharted waters for which our training and experience provide little preparation. In December 1996 the Ebonics controversy landed plumb in my backyard, however, before I could say or even think 'NIMBYI' The controversy which erupted from the Oakland School Board's December 18 resolution to recognize Ebonics as the 'primary language of African American children' and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons fell in my backyard for two reasons: (1) geography, since Oakland was one hour away from Stanford; and (2) specialization, since 1 was one of a relatively small group of linguists who had been studying African American Vernacular English (or AAVE, as sociolinguists preferred to call it) for some time, and one of only a handful of such people near Oakland, California, where the media were beginning to converge. Mary Hoover, the longtime AAVE and Education specialist from Howard University (see Hoover 1996), was working in the Oakland School District at the time, and she arranged for Carolyn Getddge, the Superintendent of the Oakland School Board, to contact me for linguistic references and information which she could use in dealing with a skeptical if not hostile press. Of course, to echo Laforest's point below with respect to the debates about Quebec French, linguists were not at first considered to have any special expertise to contribute to this issue, and the people initially quoted in the media were either policy makers (like Delaine Eastin, California Superintendent of Education, and Richard Riley, US Secretary of Education) or African American celebrities (like Maya Angelou, poet and author, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, political activist). Within a few days, however, the media began turning to linguists to provide examples and descriptions of Ebonics and",
