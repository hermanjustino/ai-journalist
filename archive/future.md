# Future Enhancement: AAVE Content Categorization by Cultural Domain

## Core Vision

This enhancement will analyze what types of content use AAVE patterns and categorize them by cultural domain, allowing researchers to understand how AAVE is represented across different subject matters and contexts in both academic and news content.

## Research Questions

1. **Where is AAVE appearing?** In which cultural domains and contexts is AAVE most frequently used or discussed?
2. **How is AAVE represented?** Are there differences in how AAVE is portrayed across different domains?
3. **Comparative analysis:** Do academic publications and news sources differ in how they incorporate AAVE across domains?

## Categorization Framework

The system will track content containing AAVE features and categorize it into these cultural domains:

- **Education & Academia**: Educational contexts, classroom discourse, academic analysis
- **Music & Entertainment**: Hip-hop, R&B, media discussions, entertainment reporting
- **Social Justice & Activism**: Civil rights discourse, community organizing, social movements 
- **Arts & Literature**: Creative expression, storytelling, poetry, literary analysis
- **Everyday Communication**: Day-to-day interactions, community contexts, social settings
- **Technology & Innovation**: Tech spaces, innovation contexts, digital communication
- **Media Representation**: How media portrays AAVE in various contexts

## Analysis Capabilities

### 1. AAVE Content Distribution

Track which types of content most commonly feature AAVE patterns:

- **Distribution Analysis**: Percentage of AAVE content across different domains
- **Source Comparison**: Compare distribution between academic and news content
- **Temporal Tracking**: Monitor how the distribution changes over time

### 2. Domain-Specific AAVE Patterns

Identify distinctive AAVE features within different domains:

- **Domain Vocabulary**: Track domain-specific AAVE terminology 
- **Pattern Frequency**: Measure which AAVE constructions appear most often in each domain
- **Contextual Analysis**: Analyze how AAVE is integrated into different professional/cultural contexts

### 3. Advanced Visualizations

- **AAVE Domain Distribution**: Visual breakdown of where AAVE appears most frequently
- **Cross-Domain Comparison**: Compare how specific AAVE features appear across different domains
- **Content Source Analysis**: Differentiate between academic articles vs. news coverage

## Research & Educational Applications

This enhancement will support:

- **Educational Contexts**: Understanding how AAVE is discussed in educational materials
- **Linguistic Research**: Analyzing domain variations in AAVE usage
- **Representation Studies**: Examining how different domains represent and incorporate AAVE
- **Cultural Analysis**: Exploring relationships between cultural contexts and linguistic features

## Implementation Approach

1. **Leverage Existing Domain Framework**: Use the archived cultural domain tracking system
2. **Enhance AAVE Pattern Recognition**: Add domain-specific AAVE pattern detection
3. **Create Content Categorization System**: Develop algorithms to classify content with AAVE
4. **Build AAVE Domain Analytics**: Create specialized visualizations for domain analysis
5. **Implement Comparison Tools**: Build tools to compare AAVE representation across domains

## Expected Outcomes

This enhancement will reveal:

1. Which cultural domains most frequently include or discuss AAVE
2. How AAVE representation differs between academic and news sources
3. Domain-specific patterns in AAVE usage and representation
4. Changing trends in how different domains incorporate AAVE over time

These insights will provide valuable information about the evolving role of AAVE across different cultural and professional contexts.
